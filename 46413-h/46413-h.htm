<p>In the statutes of the state will be found the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The day in each year known as Arbor Day shall be suitably observed
in the public schools. The Commissioner of Education shall from time
to time prepare and issue to schools such circulars of information,
advice and instruction with reference to the day as he may deem
necessary.</p>

<p>For the purpose of encouraging the planting of shade and forest trees,
the second Friday of April in each year is hereby designated as a day
for the general observance of such purpose, and to be known as Arbor
Day.</p>

<p>On said day appropriate exercises shall be introduced in all the
schools of the State, and it shall be the duty of the several county
and city superintendents to prepare a program of exercises for that
day in all the schools under their respective jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In all public schools there shall be held on the last school day
preceding the following holidays, namely, Lincoln's Birthday,
Washington's Birthday, Decoration or Memorial Day and Thanksgiving
Day, and on such other patriotic holidays as shall be established by
law, appropriate exercises for the development of a higher spirit of
patriotism.</p>

<p>It shall be the duty of the principals and teachers in the public
schools of this State to make suitable arrangements for the
celebration, by appropriate exercises among the pupils in said
schools, on the fourteenth day of June, in each year, as the day of
the adoption of the American flag by the Continental Congress.</p>
</div>

<p>The provisions of these statutes have been carried out in the
schools of the state. They are believed in and supported heartily by
the public opinion of the state.</p>

<p>In order that greater assistance may be rendered to teachers and
school officers in preparing for these special days, this pamphlet on
<i>Special Days and their Observance</i> has been prepared by the Department,
chiefly through the efforts of Mr. Z. E. Scott, Assistant Commissioner
in charge of Elementary Education.</p>

<p>The pamphlet also contains suggestions concerning the opening
exercises of schools.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott has been assisted in this work by the following persons,
the school officers having in turn been aided by their teachers. To
all these grateful acknowledgment is hereby made.</p>

</p>

<p>It has been the aim of Mr. Scott and his associates to suggest exercises
which would be appropriate for the observance of these several
days, which would be of interest to pupils, and which at the same
time would be of a character worthy of the dignity of the public
schools of the state.</p>

<p class="caption3">JENNIE HAVER, HELPING TEACHER, HUNTERDON COUNTY</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The morning exercise is a common meeting ground; it is the family
altar of the school to which each brings his offerings&mdash;the fruits of his
observations and studies, or the music, literature, and art that delight
him; a place where all cooperate for the pleasure and well-being of the
whole; where all contribute to and share the intellectual and spiritual
life of the whole; where all bring their best and choicest experiences in
the most effective form at their command.</p>
</div>


<p>This quotation from the Second Year Book of the Frances W.
Parker School may well be an inspiration, a guide, and finally, a goal
for us to use in preparation for the morning exercises.</p>

<p>The period given to the opening exercises may be made the most
important period of the day. The pupils, whether they be in a one
room rural school or a larger town school, need a more receptive
attitude toward the work before them. A short time given to interesting,
uplifting exercises will do much to control and lead the restless
children, encourage the downhearted ones, inspire the indifferent,
and give to teachers and pupils alike higher ideals for effective work
and right living.</p>

<p>A part of the time given to opening exercises should be of a devotional
nature&mdash;consisting of the reading of short selections from the
Bible, without comment&mdash;and of prayer and singing. Very careful
plans must be made for the devotional exercises if they are to function
as they should. Too often the selection of song and Bible reading is
made after the pupils are in their seats. A message that is truly
inspiring is usually the result of considerable time spent in preparation.
The thoughtful teacher will plan her opening exercises as
carefully as any other part of her regular school work.</p>

<p>The morning exercise affords an opportunity to train pupils for
leadership. Recently an interesting morning program of musical
appreciation was carried out in a two room country school. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the bell rang the twelve year old pupil leader went to the front of the
room and placed a march record on the phonograph. After the pupils
were seated she conducted the following program with a great deal
of poise and self confidence:</p>

<p class="ind30">
  <i>America</i>, by the School<br />
  Psalm XXIII<br />
  Bacarolle from "Tales of Hoffman" (phonograph)<br />
  Traumerei&mdash;Schumann (phonograph)<br />
  Spring Song&mdash;Mendelssohn (phonograph)<br />
  Flag salute, by the School
</p>

<p>Following each record on the phonograph she asked for the name
of the selection and the composer's name. It was surprising to see
how familiar even the little ones were with the classical selections.</p>

<p>Some one has said that the only influence greater than that of a
good book is personal contact with a great man or woman. Once in
a while an interesting talk may be given by a visitor, but the morning
exercise period should not be regarded as a lecture period. Occasionally
it is well to have leaders of different occupations in the
neighborhood give short, pertinent talks on their work.</p>

<p>All too often children are blind to the beauty, deaf to the music, and
almost insensible to the wonder and mystery of the great world of
nature. One day a little country girl found a large, silky, brown
cocoon and carried it to school. She didn't know what it was:
neither did her teacher. The cocoon was taken home and kept as an
object of curiosity to be shown to the neighbors when they called.
One warm spring morning a beautiful Cecropia moth, measuring
six inches from tip to tip of wing, emerged from the cocoon. That
girl will never forget her wonder and awe as she watched Nature
stage one of her most beautiful miracles. Any teacher would find
it an inspiration and a delight to bring such a charming bit of nature
into her morning exercises. Every day Nature is unfolding just as
wonderful stories. Our eyes must be open to see them.</p>

<p>The opening exercises, conducted as they should be, may be a source
of inspiration and a means of training for moral and social behavior,
for patriotism, for health, for vocational usefulness, for the right use
of leisure&mdash;in other words, for useful, patriotic citizenship.</p>

<p>There is an abundance of material on every hand that can be used
in morning exercises. Following are a few suggestions that may be
of help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3">SINGING</p>

<p>Profiting by the experience of French and English troops, instructors
taught our sailors and soldiers to sing in unison. It has been
found that singing does much to improve the morale of the company.
Singing in the morning exercises does much to socialize the group and
develop school spirit.</p>

<p>There is such a wealth of suitable songs for morning exercises that
it seems hardly necessary to suggest many. The hymns selected
should be inspiring and uplifting; the patriotic songs should be
thoroughly learned and sung in an enthusiastic manner.</p>

<p class="caption3">MUSICAL APPRECIATION</p>

<p>The introduction of the phonograph into the public school and the
multitude of records which reproduce the great masterpieces now
make it possible for every child to have an opportunity to hear and
to be taught to appreciate good music. Frequently part of the morning
exercise period should be devoted to an appreciation of good vocal
and instrumental musical selections. In one rural school the pupils
readily associate the name of the composition and composer with each
of the following records, which they helped to purchase:</p>

<p class="ind30">
  Anvil Chorus from "Il Trovatore"&mdash;Verdi<br />
  Barcarolle from "Tales of Hoffman"&mdash;Offenbach<br />
  Hearts and Flowers&mdash;Tobain<br />
  Humoresque&mdash;Dvorak<br />
  Intermezzo from "Cavalleria Rusticana"&mdash;Mascagni<br />
  Lo, Hear the Gentle Lark&mdash;Bishop<br />
  Melody in F&mdash;Rubinstein<br />
  Miserere from "Il Trovatore"&mdash;Verdi<br />
  Pilgrim's Chorus from "Tannhauser"&mdash;Wagner<br />
  Sextette from "Lucia di Lammermoor"&mdash;Donizetti<br />
  Spring Song&mdash;Mendelssohn<br />
  Traumerei&mdash;Schumann
</p>

<p>Literature on musical appreciation will be mailed free to all teachers
who request it from the educational departments of the phonograph
manufacturers.</p>

<p>Teachers who are really interested in giving their pupils the best
music will find that a number of their patrons are willing to lend
records to the school for special exercises.</p>

<p class="caption3">LITERARY EXERCISES</p>

<p>To instil in the hearts of boys and girls a love for good literature
is to give them a never ending source of happiness throughout life.
Children can be interested in books by hearing stories read, by retelling
them, and by reading them. The story of the author's life
may add interest to the author's work. Much can be done in morning
exercises to start children on the road to good reading. The more
work children do themselves the more interested they will be. Following
are suggestive literary programs:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption3">DRAMATIC EXERCISES</p>

<p>When children are truly interested in reading, the natural outlet
for the emotions aroused is dramatic action. Let different classes
be responsible for dramatizing stories from their history or reading
lessons and present the results in the morning exercises. The educative
and socializing value to the class presenting the exercise is almost
invaluable. Dramatizing the story makes an interesting incentive for
a number of language lessons; rehearsing the play provides for much
practice in oral expression; and producing the play before an audience
gives valuable training in leadership, self confidence and poise.</p>


<p class="caption3">ART APPRECIATION</p>

<p>We do not expect many of the school children to become artists,
but all can learn to appreciate and tastefully select the beautiful in
pictures, personal dress, home furnishing and decoration, and architecture.
It has been truly said, "Though we travel the world over
to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us or we find it not."</p>

<p>Frequently a few minutes of the morning exercises may be very
profitably, spent in the study of the beautiful. Artistic material to
use as illustrations for the talks is on every hand. Inexpensive reproductions
of the world's great pictures; illustrations in magazines;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
beautifully colored papers for color combinations in neckties, dress
designing and hat trimming; magazine and catalog pictures of well
designed furniture and home utensils can be easily obtained.</p>

<p class="caption3">HEALTH TALKS FOR MORNING EXERCISES</p>

<p>Truly, "A people's health's a nation's wealth," and every encouragement
should be given in school to further the doctrine of healthful
living. The medical examiner, the school nurse, the pupils and the
teachers, all may do their part to make the health talks practical and
of much value to the school.</p>

<p>A series of morning exercises may be devoted to the local history
of a community. The material may be planned by the pupils with the
assistance of some of the older people in the neighborhood. This
idea was carried out very successfully in a small town and did much
to interest the parents in the school. Many were willing to send
family heirlooms to the classroom to use as illustrations for the talks.
One charming old lady sent a written account of the history of her
old home.</p>

<p>Following are some topics that might be developed:</p>

<p class="ind30">

<p class="caption3">MORNING EXERCISES</p>

<p class="caption3">FLORENCE L. FARBER, HELPING TEACHER, SUSSEX COUNTY</p>

<p>The short period known as the opening exercise period belongs to
all the children of the school. This period should furnish especially
favorable opportunities for the development of initiative on the part
of pupils, group cooperation, development of the play spirit, interest
in community life, interest in and love for our great men and women,
and devotion to our Republic.</p>

<p>The first problem of the teacher, then, is to understand fully that
she is to a great degree responsible for furnishing aims and purposes
in this beginning period of the day, or rather in providing the situations
through which these aims and purposes may develop. When she
feels the importance of this period in the general scheme of the day's
work she will plan for it as definitely and as carefully as she will any
other part of her program. The working out of a detailed program
is of secondary importance. The thing of first importance is that
she become fully cognizant of the general aims and ideals which she
hopes to achieve. With these firmly fixed in her mind she is ready
then to cooperate with the pupils of her room in planning detailed
programs.</p>

<p>The following projects are in keeping with the principles presented
and have been found stimulating in one and two room schools:</p>

<p><b>Project 1.</b> The teacher divides her children into groups on the
basis of age and ability. For example, in a one room school a teacher
might have two groups. Each group is to work out with the teacher
a program which it is to give and for which it is responsible. This
program may consist of a short story to be dramatized, the story to
contain not more than two or three important scenes. The costuming,
if any is needed, is to be done by pupils and teacher. Rehearsing is
to be directed by the teacher. When the program is presented it
should be as a new production to all the school except those who are
engaged in presenting it. It is to be given, therefore, as a real play
to a real audience. Each pupil should invite a member of the family
or a friend.</p>

<p>The value of such work will soon be noticed in a better social spirit
among the children. The dramatizations given may furnish the
material for both oral and written language lessons. Dramatization
itself will provide excellent practice in oral expression and also training
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in initiative, leadership and cooperation. The story presented may
furnish many funny settings which the pupils may enjoy with abandon.
And what children do not need real merriment in school! Opportunity
ought to be afforded all children of our public schools to enjoy
a real laugh at least once each day.</p>

<p>Teachers need have no fear that the different groups will be over-critical
or discourteous to one another. They will understand that
they are being entertained and they will cooperate to make the play
given worth while.</p>

<p>The following stories lend themselves very readily to dramatization.</p>

<p class="center"><b>First and Second Grades</b></p>

<p class="ind30">

  The Man Without a Country
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Project 2.</b> A special problem in history or geography, for example,
may be taken up, such as the life of the people in Japan, or
the life of the people on a cattle ranch. In either case the class that
presents the work as an opening exercise should be given opportunity
to work out certain scenes which it wants to give. These scenes should
be presented either by sand-table, by charts, by posters, by pictures
from magazines, or by dramatization on the part of the children.
Preparation of such work is decidedly worth while, and ought to be
a regular part of the day's program. The important scenes should be
rehearsed before the final presentation.</p>

<p><b>Project 3. Poster exhibit.</b> This project could be arranged for
all the children of a given school, in which case the best work would
be selected and the children presenting it would discuss each poster
in one or two minute talks. A still better way to handle the project
would be to have the best posters from different schools. In this case
at least one pupil from each school should be invited to present the
posters from his school.</p>

<p><b>Project 4. War programs.</b> A war opening exercise program
could be worked out by the children of a given school. This could be
done by having children collect war posters and war pictures made
during the recent world war and arrange them in such a way that
they tell a connected story. A group should be held responsible for
presenting each story or part of a story. A sand-table should be provided
if necessary.</p>

<p>An excellent war program could be provided by having the emphasis
placed upon the various men who have led or are leading in our own
national life. Pictures of these men should be secured and children
called upon to tell what important work each man has done or is
doing. This same device could be carried a step further and a special
program arranged, centering around the pictures of the different men
who led the allied forces. The older pupils of any school ought to be
able to do this work.</p>

<p>An additional way by which our schools may help in the work of
patriotism is to have an opening exercise by the children whose immediate
relatives were at the front. Such a program ought to have
for its purpose the idea of service to one's country.</p>

<p>Another helpful device would be to have at an appropriate time
former soldiers come to the school and talk to the children concerning
the meaning of the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The teacher who plans her opening exercise periods in keeping with
the foregoing presentation will make these periods inspiring and helpful
to herself and her children. She will be putting across the gospel
of good cheer, and cooperation in the new kind of school which offers
opportunities for participation in life's present day activities, not
preparation for future activities.</p>


<p class="caption3">OPENING EXERCISES</p>

<p class="caption3">LOUIS H. BURCH, PRINCIPAL BANGS AVENUE SCHOOL, ASBURY PARK</p>

<p>Play is one of the first manifestations of the child in self expression.
As the child grows older this play is made up in part of the imitation
of the doings and sayings of the older persons and playmates with
whom he is associated. The child reflects the life of his parents
wherever it comes under his comprehension. The stick horse gives as
much pleasure to the boy as the well trained saddle horse gives to the
father.</p>

<p>When the child enters school much of the play element of his life
is left behind, and teachers have often failed to use to advantage the
experience and knowledge the child has in "living over" the actions
and sayings of others. The ordinary child has observed the animals
and birds around him and can imitate them. He can personify the
tree, the flower, or the brook, and gain a clearer knowledge of the
purpose and function of the thing personified by so doing. Under
the proper direction of the teacher nearly all the common occurrences
of life may be dramatized by the children in the ordinary schoolroom
and with few so-called stage properties.</p>

<p>Older children are interested in the simple dramatizations of the
little folks and should have opportunity to see them often, not alone
to be entertained, but to be reminded of the simple and easy ways of
"playing you are someone else." A grammar grade class may learn
many things from watching a primary class dramatize "Three Bears,"
"Little Red Hen," or "Little Red Ridinghood."</p>

<p>The simple dramatization in the schoolroom furnish excellent
material for general assemblies or morning exercises. Simple costumes
and stage settings satisfy the children, and the setting of the stage or
platform for the scene should, in most cases, be done before the children.
Children who see the table set, the chairs placed, and the beds
prepared for the "Three Bears" know how to get ready for their play
when they are called upon to contribute their part for the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Children will bring material for their costumes and stage furnishings
from home and should be encouraged to do so. Parents will come to
see children take part in a program when nothing else would attract
them to the school, and if the home is to be called upon to help the
school there must be a closer relationship between parents and teacher.</p>

<p>In preparing dramatizations for elementary school pupils but few
scenes should be chosen, and in those selected the language and action
should be simple and within the capabilities of the children.</p>

<p>The following dramatizations were worked out by teachers and
pupils of our building as class projects. They were presented in the
opening exercises as worth-while classroom projects which would be
entertaining and helpful to all pupils of the school, to teachers and
to parents. In presenting these scenes the pupils secured excellent
practice in oral English work, in dramatic action, and in community
and group cooperation. The pupils and teachers who made up the
audience enjoyed opening exercises in which there was purpose. All
entered into the spirit of the play; all enjoyed the exercises without
having to think why. The results have been better team work between
teacher and pupils, better school spirit, more pupil participation in
leadership activities.</p>


<p class="caption3">The History of Cotton</p>

<p class="caption3"><i>Prepared by Bessie O'Hagen, Teacher of Fourth Grade, Bangs Avenue
School, Asbury Park</i></p>

<p><i>Characters</i>: Spirit of Cotton, Little Girl, Maiden from India, Maiden
from Egypt, Maiden from America, Spirit of Eli Whitney.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl</i> (<i>coming into the room in bad humor</i>). I hate this old
cotton dress. I wish I had a silk one. I don't see why we have to use
cotton anyway. We have to have cotton dresses, cotton sheets, cotton
stockings, cotton everything. I just hate cotton! I'm not going out to
play or anything. (<i>Finally sits down.</i>) I am so tired. I wish I had a
silk dress. I hate this cotton dress. (<i>Falls asleep.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton</i> (<i>skipping into the room</i>). Heigh ho! Ho heigh! Here
am I, the Spirit of Cotton. I heard what you said, little girl. Did you
ever see cotton grow?</p>

<p><i>Little Girl</i> (<i>frightened</i>). Why, no.</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton.</i> How do you know whether it is interesting or not?
I will tell you the story of my life. In the early spring the planter
gets the ground ready for me. As soon as the frost is out of the
ground, he plants me.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> What happens then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton.</i> The good earth gives me food. The sun and rain make
me grow, and soon&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heigh ho! Ho heigh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tall plant of cotton.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> How do you look?</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton.</i> My leaves are green like the maple. I have lovely
blossoms. They are white the first day and pink the next.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> I thought you said that you were a cotton plant.</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton.</i> So I did. My blossoms fall off, and then&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heigh ho! Ho heigh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nice bunch of cotton.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> Is that all?</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton.</i> No, I have some friends who will tell you more
about my life. (<i>Goes out and returns leading a little girl by the
hand.</i>) This is my friend from India. (<i>Goes out again.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> How did you get here?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from India.</i> I heard the Spirit of Cotton calling and I obeyed.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl</i> (<i>pointing to a map of Asia which is pinned on Maiden
from India</i>). Is this your country?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from India.</i> Yes, I have come to tell you something about
cotton in my country. Cotton was first raised in my country. That was
long, long, long ago.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> A hundred years ago?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from India.</i> We knew how to weave cotton thousands of years ago.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> Did you know how to weave well?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from India.</i> We made such fine dresses that you could draw a
whole one through your ring.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> I don't believe I could draw my dress through my ring.</p>

<p><i>Maiden from India.</i> I know you couldn't.</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton</i> (<i>outside</i>). Heigh ho! Ho heigh!</p>

<p><i>Maiden from India.</i> I must return. The Spirit of Cotton is calling.
(<i>Goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton</i> (<i>comes in, leading a little girl by the hand</i>).
This is my friend from Egypt. She has something to tell you too. (<i>Goes
out.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> Do you know about cotton?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from Egypt.</i> Yes, we knew how to use cotton long before your
country was even heard of.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> Is this your country (<i>pointing to a map</i>)?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from Egypt.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> Did your people like cotton dresses?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from Egypt.</i> Yes; just think how warm those woolen ones were.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> I guess every one who ever lived must have liked cotton.</p>

<p><i>Maiden from Egypt.</i> All good children do now.</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton</i> (<i>outside</i>). Heigh ho! Ho heigh!</p>

<p><i>Maiden from Egypt.</i> I must go. I hear the Spirit of Cotton calling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton</i> (<i>bringing a little girl into the room</i>). This is my
friend from America. (<i>Goes out again.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> I know you. We studied that map in school. You are from
the United States. What did America have to do with cotton?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from America.</i> When Columbus first landed on the Bahama Islands
the natives came out to his ships in canoes, bringing cotton thread and
yarn to trade.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> That was in 1492, wasn't it?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from America.</i> Yes, it was 427 years ago.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> Why did you put all this cotton here (<i>points to cotton
pasted on different states</i>)?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from America.</i> They are the cotton states.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> I know which ones they are&mdash;North Carolina, South
Carolina, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas. Did America do anything
wonderful with cotton?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from America.</i> Yes; we raise more cotton than any other place
in the world. It is the best cotton too.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> I am so glad of that. We won't let India and Egypt get
ahead of us, will we?</p>

<p><i>Maiden from America.</i> Of course not. All good little girls must help
too.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> I shall always like cotton after this.</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton</i> (<i>outside</i>). Heigh ho! Ho heigh!</p>

<p><i>Maiden from America.</i> I hear the Spirit of Cotton calling; I must go.
(<i>Goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton</i> (<i>leading a boy into the room</i>). This is my friend
Eli Whitney. (<i>Goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Eli Whitney.</i> I am the Spirit of Eli Whitney. I was born in
Massachusetts in 1765. One day when my father went to church, I took
his watch to pieces and put it together again. Then I thought I would
go to Yale College. When I finished Yale College I went to Georgia. I
heard everyone there talking about cotton. They were trying to find out
how to get the seeds out of it more easily. I invented the cotton gin.</p>

<p><i>Little Girl.</i> What happened then?</p>

<p><i>Eli Whitney.</i> One man could now clean fifty times as much cotton as he
could before.</p>

<p><i>Spirit of Cotton</i> (<i>outside</i>). Heigh ho! Ho heigh!</p>

<p><i>Eli Whitney.</i> I hear the Spirit of Cotton calling; I must go. (<i>Goes
out.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Little Girl</i> (<i>waking up</i>). Where is the spirit of Cotton? Where is
the Maiden from India? Where is the Spirit of Eli Whitney? It must
have been a dream! I guess I got up on the wrong side of the bed this
morning. I will always like cotton after this. I am going out to play
now.</p>

<p>
<i>Enter the Farmer and the Cat</i><br />

<p><i>Fox.</i> Good morning. What fine fur you have! What long whiskers
you have! Who are you?</p>

<p><i>Cat.</i> I am Ivan, the owner of this forest.</p>

<p><i>Fox.</i> May I be your servant?</p>

<p><i>Cat.</i> Yes; you may. Come into my house. (<i>Both go in house.</i>) I am
hungry. Go out and get me something to eat.</p>

<p><i>Fox.</i> I will go. (<i>Goes into forest and meets Wolf.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> Good morning.</p>

<p><i>Fox.</i> Good morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Fox returns to the house and enters</i></p>

<p><i>Cat.</i> Did you bring me something to eat?</p>

<p><i>Fox.</i> No; but I have sent for something and it will be here soon.</p>

<p><i>Bear.</i> So am I. Let us go together.</p>

<p><i>Bear and Wolf walk to Cat's house and place sheep and cow near door</i></p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> You knock on the door.</p>

<p><i>Bear.</i> No; you knock on the door. I am afraid.</p>

<p><i>Wolf.</i> So am I. Shall we ask Mr. Rabbit to do it?</p>

<p><i>Bear.</i> Yes; you ask him.</p>

<p><i>Wolf</i> (<i>calling to a rabbit who is passing</i>). Hello, Mr. Rabbit; will you
knock at the Cat's door for us?</p>

<p><i>Rabbit.</i> Yes, I will. <i>(Knocks.)</i></p>

<p><i>Bear and Wolf hide behind the trees and bushes</i></p>

<p><i>Cat</i> (<i>coming out of his house with the Fox and noticing the cow and
sheep lying by the door</i>). Look! here is what you got for my dinner.
There is only enough for two bites.</p>

<p><i>Bear</i> (<i>to himself</i>). How hungry he is. A cow would be enough to eat
for four bears and he says it is only enough for two bites. What a terrible
animal he is.</p>

<p><i>Cat</i> (<i>seeing Wolf behind the bushes</i>). Look! there is a mouse. I must
catch him and eat him. (<i>Chases Wolf away.</i>) I think I hear another
mouse. (<i>Sees Bear and tries to catch him but fails.</i>) I am so tired that
I cannot run at all. Let us sit by the door and eat our dinner. (<i>Cat and
Fox sit down and eat the sheep and cow.</i>)</p>

<p class="caption2">COLUMBUS DAY</p>

<p class="caption3">J. CAYCE MORRISON, SUPERVISING PRINCIPAL, LEONIA</p>


<p>October 12, 1492! What a date in the world's history&mdash;the linking
of the new world with the old&mdash;the dreams of a dreamer come true&mdash;the
opening of the gates to a newer and better home for man&mdash;the
promise of&mdash;America!</p>

<p>The story of Columbus is a story of romance, of patient perseverance,
of high endeavor, of noble resolve&mdash;a story that grips and thrills.
Every boy and every girl who feels the story wants to discover a new
world; and out of that desire may well come the discovery of America&mdash;its
aims, ideals, opportunities. The Columbus Day program is an
opportunity to discover the new world into which we are emerging.
Even childhood in the school may come to glimpse that which lies
beyond and feel the exultation of the sailor who cried, "Land! Land!"</p>

<p>The materials of this program are largely suggestive. It is hoped
that they may be of service in program making from kindergarten to
high school.</p>

<p>The school program of most value is that which results from the
creative genius of the children themselves. Let children live the life
of Columbus in imagination and they will create their own program
and express it in costume, tableaux, music, composition, acting, and
dialog. The merit of the Columbus Day program will lie in its leading
children, through their own expression, to a better understanding of
their country, to a broader conception of patriotism.</p>

<p>The children stand in a circle. They choose one to represent Columbus.
The children all sing the song (given below). As they sing the fifth line
Columbus points to three children, who become the Nina (baby), the
Pinta, and the Santa Maria. These three children come inside the circle,
and wave arms up and down as though sailing. The children now all repeat
the song, marching round in the circle, waving arms up and down,
and the children inside the circle skip round also.</p>

chosen as Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria choose three children to take their

<p class="caption3">CLASS EXERCISE FOR COLUMBUS DAY</p>

<p>The foundation for these exercises should be laid in previous class
recitations and specially prepared class compositions which relate
developing incidents in the life of Columbus. Several periods used
in the preparation of these oral and written exercises will be time well
spent. Select the composition which portrays the life pictures most
clearly and effectively; and as the writer reads his story, let other
members of the class give tableaux or act scenes apropos. The children
should be encouraged to initiate their own ideas and execute their
own mental pictures in costume, arrangement, facial expression, etc.</p>

<p>The following are mentioned <i>suggestively</i>:</p>


<p>Acts portraying the life of Columbus</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Columbus, the boy</p>

<p>Boy of nine to eleven years, seated, intently studying a geography,</p>

<p><i>or</i></p>

<p>Boy whittling a wooden toy ship.</p>

<p>2. Columbus, the man</p>

<p>Larger boy, posing as a dreamer, gazing at and studying the
stars, <i>or</i></p>

<p>Larger boy drawing maps, appearing wise and thoughtful.</p>

<p>(Let others stand aside, smiling and mockingly pointing.)</p>

<p>3. Columbus' appearance before King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella</p>

<p>King and Queen, dressed in royal style, on improvised throne; Columbus
kneeling before them; the queen offering him her
jewels.</p>

<p>4. On shipboard</p>

<p>Boys representing mutinous sailors, their faces depicting fear,
anger, dejection&mdash;dressed sailor fashion.</p>

<p>Columbus displaying confidence, courage and patience&mdash;dressed in
short full trousers, cape over his shoulders thrown back on one
side. Let facial expressions and actions change to show land
has been sighted.</p>

<p>5. The landing</p>

<p>Columbus planting the flag of Spain in the New World. Sailors
(all with uncovered heads) kneeling. Indians (let the boys
wear Indian suits) watching from the outskirts, one falling
down in worship.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>6. The return reception</p>

<p>King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella on throne, dressed as before,
with guards on either side. Ladies-in-waiting, noblemen, etc.,

(to music). All bow low except king and queen, who rise to
meet him. Columbus kneels before them, kisses the queen's
hand and rises.</p>

<p>Indians enter (with bow and arrow) and gaze in wonder about.
One Indian plucks Columbus by sleeve and gruntingly interrogates
him concerning some wonder in the room&mdash;a picture of
the king and queen, decorated with Spanish flags. The king
takes the hand of the Indian, places it in Columbus' hand and,
covering them with his own left hand, raises the right to signify
his blessing upon the newly found land.</p>

<p>Music gives the signal for the recessional. All fall into line and
march out&mdash;guards, king, queen, Columbus, ladies, and courtiers.
The Indians follow irregularly.</p>

<p class="caption3">COLUMBUS AND THE EGG</p>

<p>One day Columbus was at a dinner which a Spanish gentleman had
given in his honor, and several persons were present who were jealous of
the great Admiral's success. They were proud, conceited fellows, and they
very soon began to try to make Columbus uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"You have discovered strange lands beyond the seas," they said, "but
what of that? We do not see why there should be so much said about it.
Anybody can sail across the ocean; and anybody can coast along the
islands on the other side, just as you have done. It is the simplest thing
in the world."</p>

<p>Columbus made no answer; but after a while he took an egg from a
dish and said to the company:</p>

<p>"Who among you, gentlemen, can make this egg stand on end?"</p>

<p>One by one those at the table tried the experiment. When the egg had
gone entirely around and none had succeeded, all said that it could not
be done.</p>

<p>Then Columbus took the egg and struck its small end gently upon the
table so as to break the shell a little. After that there was no trouble in
making it stand upright.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "what is easier than to do this which you said
was impossible? It is the simplest thing in the world. Anybody can do
it&mdash;after he has been shown how!"</p>


<p class="caption3">COLUMBUS DAY</p>

<p class="caption3">(<i>Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Normal School</i>)</p>

<p>This entertainment is simply an attempt to give a few of the most
dramatic incidents in the life of Columbus as connected with his discovery
of the New World. Other scenes could be readily added, although it would
require some care to avoid an anti-climax.</p>


<p>A. In Spain at the Council of Salamanca</p>

<p>Before this scene is presented give a brief explanation and description
of the early life of Columbus and his attempts to obtain aid.</p>

<p><i>Characters</i>: Churchmen and counselors at the court of Spain (seven
to ten) and Columbus.</p>

<p><i>Costumes</i>: The <i>churchmen</i> are dressed in long black garments, except
two, who have black capes with white underneath. Columbus wears a
long, black garment or coat, which plainly shows the poverty of its
owner.</p>


<p><i>Tableau I&mdash;Columbus before the Council at Salamanca</i></p>

<p>The characters are arranged somewhat as in a picture of this scene
found in the Perry pictures. A picture of this scene is also found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Lossing's History of the United States, volume I. Only the chief characters
are shown in this tableau. Three churchmen or counselors are in
center near Columbus; two at left, one pointing mockingly, or making
fun of Columbus; two stand haughtily in the back, and there may also
be two or three at right. Columbus has a partly open roll of parchment
in one hand and is pointing with the other. One of the churchmen in the
center has an open Bible in his hand, and another has a book which he is
holding out to Columbus.</p>


<p>B. On Shipboard</p>

<p><i>Characters</i>: Columbus, the mate, other sailors.</p>

<p><i>Costumes</i>: Columbus, red cape; sailors, sweaters and sailor caps.</p>


<p><i>Tableau II&mdash;Nearing Land; Columbus and the Mate</i></p>

<p>The conversation in Joaquin Miller's "Columbus" takes place between
Columbus and mate. The sailors are in the background, one holding a
lantern. Between the different parts of his conversation with Columbus,
the mate goes to consult with the sailors. The last stanza of the poem is
given by some one from the wings. When the reader reaches the line,
"A light! A light!" Columbus and the mate change their position. Columbus
points and the mate raises his arm, peering forward. (Picture in
"Leading Facts of American History," by Montgomery, revised edition.
Also in "Stepping Stones of American History.")</p>


<p>C. In the new world</p>

<p><i>Characters</i>: Columbus, three noblemen, eight sailors, six Indians.</p>

<p><i>Costumes</i>: Columbus and the noblemen wear the Spanish costume of
the fifteenth century (described later). Sailors wear sweaters and sailor
caps made from blue, red or grey cambric. Indians wear Indian suits
(nearly all boys have or may obtain them from any clothing store).
They carry bows and arrows or tomahawks. The spears and swords for
this and the following scene are made from wood, bronzed to look like
silver. The tall cross is made of wood and stained with shellac. The
banner of the expedition is white, with a green cross. Over the initials
F and Y (Ferdinand and Ysabella) are two gilt crowns.</p>


<p><i>Tableau III&mdash;The landing of Columbus</i></p>

<p>The characters are posed from Vanderlyn's painting of the scene in
the Capitol at Washington. Reproductions are found in many histories
and among the Perry pictures. Columbus holds the banner of the expedition
in one hand, and a drawn sword in the other. One of the men has a
tall staff with the top in form of a cross; two others hold tall spears.
The Indians are peering out at the white men from the sides of the stage;
one of them is down on the stage with his head bowed on his hands, worshipping
the strangers; the others seem to be full of fear and curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>


<p>D. At Barcelona in Spain</p>

<p>Before this scene is presented a description of the reception of Columbus
by the king and queen upon his return to Spain is given. This scene
is more elaborate than any of the others.</p>

<p><i>Characters and costumes</i>: Queen, red robe, purple figured front; collar
and trimmings of ermine. She wears a crown. Ermine is made of cotton
with little pieces of black cloth sewed on it, crown of cardboard covered
with gilt paper. Dress cheesecloth with a front of silkoline.</p>

<p>King wears purple full, short trousers (trunks), purple doublet, purple
cape and gilt crown. The trousers and cape are trimmed with ermine.</p>

<p>The two guards have black trousers (trunks) and red capes, collars, and
knee pieces made from silver paper; they wear storm hats covered with
silver paper, and carry spears.</p>

<p>The two ladies-in-waiting wear dresses fixed to resemble the dress of the
period. They have high headpieces shaped like cornucopias, made from
cardboard covered with gilt paper, and with long veils draped over them;
this was one style of headpiece worn in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The eight churchmen, eight sailors and six Indians are dressed as in
previous scenes.</p>

<p>The little page of Columbus is dressed in his own white suit.</p>

<p>Columbus wears grey and red clothing. The ten noblemen wear combinations
of bright colors.</p>

<p>The general plan in regard to the dress of the Spanish nobility in the
time of Columbus is to have the full, short trousers (trunks) made of one
color and slashed with another; the upper garment or doublet made of
figured silkoline; the cape of one color lined with another, worn turned
back over one shoulder; pointed collars and cuffs of white glazed or silver
paper; and soft felt hats with plumes. Each nobleman carries a sword.</p>

<p>The gold brought by the sailors may be made by gilding stones.</p>


<p><i>Tableau IV&mdash;Reception of Columbus by King and Queen</i></p>

<p>In center of stage is raised platform or throne with two or three steps
leading up to it: this throne is covered with figured raw silk (yellow and
brown). Chairs are placed on throne for king and queen.</p>

<p>The scene is an attempt to represent the reception of Columbus on his
return to Spain after his first voyage. (See painting by Ricardo Balaca,
the Spanish artist, of Columbus before Ferdinand and Isabella at Barcelona.)</p>

<p>A march may be played on the piano while the different characters in
the tableau come on the stage and take their proper positions. First the
two royal guards march to the throne, taking positions one on each side,
so that the king and queen may pass between them in mounting the platform.
They are followed by the king and queen, and then the ladies-in-waiting.
The king and queen mount the platform and take seats; the
ladies wait in front of the platform until the king and queen are seated,
then they take positions on each side of the throne. The guards, after the
king and queen are seated, take positions on the platform in the rear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
All these come as one group in the procession, with only a little space
between them.</p>

<p>Next come the churchmen. One of them carries the tall cross. They
take their places at the right of the queen.</p>

<p>The Indians come, shuffling across the stage to the extreme left of the
king and queen. Of course they know nothing of keeping time to the
music or paying homage to royalty.</p>

<p>The sailors march upon the stage, each bringing something from the
New World&mdash;gold, a stuffed bird, or some product. Each in turn approaches
the king and queen, kneels, and then places whatever he carries
at the side of the platform, and takes his place on the left.</p>

<p>The noblemen, one by one, come in with great dignity, go to the front
of the throne, kneel and salute with their swords. Then they go to the
right of the stage.</p>

<p>Finally the music sounds a more triumphal note, announcing the approach
of the hero of the occasion. Columbus is preceded by his page,
carrying the banner of the expedition. The page kneels to the king and
queen, then goes to the left, where he is to stand just back of the place reserved
for Columbus.</p>

<p>As Columbus approaches the throne, the king and queen rise and come
forward to do him honor. Columbus kneels, kisses the queen's hand, then
rises and points out to the king and queen the treasures which his sailors
have brought. He also brings forward one of the Indians. The king and
queen regard everything with interest. After this, at a signal given on
the piano, all kneel to give thanks for the discovery of the New World.
The Te Deum Laudamus is chanted or the Doxology is sung.</p>

<p>This is the end of the reception.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This scene may be simplified, if desired, and given in the form of two
tableaux. Columbus kneeling before the queen and king and Columbus
telling his story may be given separately. There need not be as many
characters in the scene. See the picture, "Reception of Columbus"
(adapted from the picture by Ricardo Balaca) in "America's Story for
American Children," by Mara L. Pratt.</p>

<p>It would be easy to give the substance of this entertainment in any
schoolroom and without costumes. Even with these limitations the story
of Columbus would become more real to the children in this way than it
could be made by any description.</p>

<p>A good description of the reception of Columbus in Spain after his first

<p class="caption3">THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA</p>

<p>It was on the morning of Friday, 12th of October, 1492, that Columbus
first beheld the New World....</p>

<p>No sooner did he land than he threw himself upon his knees, kissed the
earth, and returned thanks to God with tears of joy. His example was
followed by the rest, whose hearts indeed overflowed with the same feelings
of gratitude.</p>

<p>Columbus then rising drew his sword, displayed the royal standard, and
... took solemn possession in the name of the Castilian sovereigns,
giving the island the name of San Salvador. Having complied with the
requisite forms and ceremonies, he now called upon all present to take the
oath of obedience to him, as admiral and viceroy, representing the persons
of the sovereigns.</p>

<p>The feelings of the crew now burst forth in the most extravagant transports....
They thronged around the Admiral in their overflowing
zeal. Some embraced him, others kissed his hands. Those who had been
most mutinous and turbulent during the voyage, were now most devoted
and enthusiastic. Some begged favors of him, as of a man who had already
wealth and honors in his gift. Many abject spirits, who had outraged
him by their insolence, now crouched as it were at his feet, begging
pardon for all the trouble they had caused him, and offering for the
future the blindest obedience to his commands.</p>

<p>All hail, Columbus, discoverer, dreamer, hero, and apostle! We here,
of every race and country, recognize the horizon which bounded his
vision, and the infinite scope of his genius. The voice of gratitude and
praise for all the blessings which have been showered upon mankind by
his adventure is limited to no language, but is uttered in every tongue.
Neither marble nor brass can fitly form his statue. Continents are his
monument, and unnumbered millions, past, present, and to come, who
enjoy in their liberties and their happiness the fruits of his faith, will
reverently guard and preserve, from century to century, his name and
fame.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Chauncey Mitchell Depew</i><br /></p>

<p>Little wonder that the whole world takes from the life of Columbus one
of its best-beloved illustrations of the absolute power of faith. To a faithless
world he made a proposal, and the world did not hear it. To that
faithless world he made it again and again, and at last roused the world
to ridicule it and to contradict it. To the same faithless world he still
made it year after year; and at last the world said that, when it was
ready, it would try if he were right; to which his only reply is that he is
ready now, that the world must send him now on the expedition which
shall show whether he is right or wrong. The world, tired of his importunity,
consents, unwillingly enough, that he shall try the experiment.
He tries it; he succeeds; and the world turns round and welcomes him
with a welcome which it cannot give to a conqueror. In a moment the
grandeur of his plans is admitted, their success is acknowledged, and his
place is fixed as one of the great men of history.</p>

<p>The fame of Columbus is not local or limited. It does not belong to
any single country or people. It is the proud possession of the whole
civilized world. In all the transactions of history there is no act which
for vastness and performance can be compared with the discovery of the
continent of America, "the like of which was never done by any man in
ancient or in later times."</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>James Grant Wilson</i><br /></p>

<p>With boldness unmatched, with faith in the teachings of science and of
revelation immovable, with patience and perseverance that knew no weariness,
with superior skill as a navigator unquestioned, and with a lofty
courage unrivaled in the history of the race, Columbus sailed from Palos
on the 3d of August, with three vessels, the largest (his flagship) of only
ninety feet keel, and provided with four masts, eight anchors, and sixty-six
seamen. Passing the Canaries and the blazing peak of Teneriffe, he
pushed westward into the "sea of darkness," in defiance of the fierce
dragons with which superstition had peopled it, and the prayers and
threats of his mutinous seamen, and on the 12th of October landed on one
of the Bahama Islands.</p>

<p>With all the visionary fervor of his imagination, its fondest dreams fell
short of the reality. He died in ignorance of the real grandeur of his discovery.
Until his last breath, he entertained the idea that he had merely
opened a new way to the old resorts of opulent commerce, and had discovered
some of the wild regions of the East.... What visions of
glory would have broke upon his mind, could he have known that he had
indeed discovered a new continent, equal to the whole of the old world
in magnitude, and separated by two vast oceans from all of the earth
hitherto known by civilized man; and how would his magnanimous spirit
have been consoled, amidst the chills of age and cares of penury, the
neglect of a fickle public, and the injustice of an ungrateful king, could
he have anticipated the splendid empires which were to spread over the
beautiful world he had discovered, and the nations, and tongues, and languages,
which were to fill its lands with his renown, and to revere and
bless his name to the latest posterity!</p>

<p>Of no use are the men who study to do exactly as was done before, who
can never understand that today is a new day. There never was such a
combination as this of ours, and the rules to meet it are not set down in
any history. We want men of original perception and original action,
who can open their eyes wider than to a nationality&mdash;namely, to considerations
of benefit to the human race&mdash;can act in the interest of civilization;
men of elastic, men of moral mind, who can live in the moment and
take a step forward. Columbus was no backward-creeping crab, nor was
Martin Luther, nor John Adams, nor Patrick Henry, nor Thomas Jefferson;
and the Genius or Destiny of America is no log or sluggard, but a
man incessantly advancing, as the shadow on the dial's face, or the
heavenly body by whose light it is marked.</p>

<p>OUR NATIONAL IDEALS<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> Used by permission of, and by special arrangement with, Houghton Mifflin Company,
the authorized publishers.</p>
</div>

<p>Foremost among the ideals which have characterized our national life
is the spirit of self-reliance. The very first chapter of our national history
records the story of a man, who arose from among the toilers of his
time, and whom eighteen years of disappointed hopes could not dismay.
It tells how this man, holding out the promise of a new dominion, at last
overcame the opposition of royal courtiers, and secured the tardy support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of reluctant rulers. And when, at Palos, Columbus flung to the breeze the
sails of his frail craft, and ventured upon that unknown ocean from
which, according to the belief of his age, there was no hope of return, he
displayed the chief characteristic of the American people&mdash;the spirit of
self-reliance.</p>

<p>What is this spirit? Emerson has expressed it in a sentence: "We
will walk on our own feet; we will work with our own hands; we will
speak our own minds." This was the spirit which animated that little
group of colonists who preferred the unknown hardships of the new
world to the certain tyranny of the old; who chose to break old ties, to
brave the sea, to face the loneliness and perils of life in a strange land&mdash;a
land of difficulties and dangers, but a land of liberty and opportunity....</p>

<p>In order that our country may continue this proud record of self-reliance,
each one of us has a special obligation. Every citizen in his individual
life should live up to the same ideal of self-reliance. The young
citizen who relies on himself, who does honest work in school, never
cheating or shirking, who is always, ready to do a little more than is
actually required of him, who thinks for himself, acts rightly because he
loves right actions&mdash;such a citizen is doing his part in helping to achieve
our national ideal of self-reliance.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>William Backus Guitteau</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>I believe in my country. I believe in it because it is made up of my
fellow-men&mdash;and myself. I can't go back on either of us and be true to
my creed. If it isn't the best country in the world it is partly because I
am not the kind of a man that I should be.</p>

<p>Among our national holidays Thanksgiving should be a red letter
day. We need these days so that the modern tendency of reducing all
days to the same mediocre level may be overcome. Such days, when
contrasted with common school days, show a wonderful stimulation.
Hence it is urged that the celebration of Thanksgiving take on the
aspect of the play-festival. The play-festival will have a potent effect
on the audience and the actors. The audience will be composed for
the most part of the school body and on this body the festival program
will have a unifying effect. For this reason it is further urged
that an entire grade, or perhaps a group of grades, be employed to
render the program. Such a rendition will be treated as a contribution
from a part to the whole.</p>

<p>The festival to be effective must bind the entire school into one
social group. The response of the audience will be complementary
and the spirit and the pride of the school will give forth inspiration
to the actor and the audience. The performer must make others feel
what he knows, and thus his learning becomes intensified. The result
is that the play-festival has two high values, the social and the educational.</p>

<p>The essential problem which arises, and which must be answered by
every teacher, is, "What shall be done to provide a good program, and
how shall it be done?" The answer will come from a careful survey of
the needs, capacities, and make-up of each individual or group of
pupils. The answer includes the utilization of the dramatic instinct,
i. e., the play instinct, which finds expression through singing, speaking
and dancing. The successful festival must be well organized, and
this organization must be effected according to a suitable program.
(1) The history of the day must be clearly brought to the attention
of the pupils. (2) There should be a committee appointed to have
supervision of the arranging of the festival. (3) A program full of
content should-be arranged. (4) What constitutes the proper program
for a Thanksgiving festival should have the careful thought of those
in charge. The children should be actual factors in planning the
program, as well as in presenting it.</p>

<p>In order that Thanksgiving Day may be celebrated in an appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
manner it is necessary that its history be fully comprehended
by the entire school. Teachers of all grades should use the historic
material that will meet the needs and capacities of their pupils. This
material should be correlated with as much of the regular school work
as may seem advisable. It is essential that the entire school fully
appreciate the historic foundations of the day, so that they may comprehend
the setting which has so much to do with this holiday.
Furthermore, a full comprehension of the history as a background for
this festival will stimulate the school audience, so that they will receive
from the program those things which we believe they ought to
receive from the celebration.</p>


<p class="caption3">HISTORY</p>

<p>The following extracts relative to the history of Thanksgiving have
been selected because they are exceptionally interesting; they show
that traditionally the celebration of this holiday is truly American;
they also give hints as to the wealth of material that may be woven
into a program for the play-festival.</p>

<p>The first year of the Pilgrim settlement, in spite of that awful
winter when nearly half of their number perished, had been comparatively
successful. The Pilgrims had planted themselves well, and it
is easy to understand why this fact should have appealed to the mind
of their governor, William Bradford, as an especial reason for proclaiming
a season of thanksgiving. The exact date is not certain, but
from the records we learn that it was an open air feast. It is evident
that it must have occurred in that lovely period of balmy, calm, cool
air and soft sunshine which is called Indian Summer, and which may
be considered to range between the latter week of October and the
latter week of November. It came at the end of the year's harvest.
In confirmation, let us quote from the writing of Edward Winslow,
thrice governor of the Pilgrims:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Our corn did prove well; and, God be praised, we had a good increase
of Indian corn, and our barley indifferent good. Our harvest being gotten
in, our governor sent four men on fowling that so we might after a
special manner rejoice together after we had gathered the fruit of our
labors."</p>
</div>

<p>We learn that as a result of this hunting expedition they had many
wild turkeys, which the women probably stuffed with beechnuts, and
they brought home wood pigeons and partridges in abundance. But,
it seems, they must have lacked deer, since the Indians, with their
king, Massasoit, volunteered to go out and bring in the venison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>One noteworthy fact is the relations that existed between the Pilgrims
and the Indians. At this first Thanksgiving feast King Massasoit
and ninety of his warriors were present. They entered heartily
into the preparations of thanksgiving. What a cheerful spectacle it
must have been to see the Indian guests appearing, carrying a many
branched buck or a pretty doe, possibly hung across the stalwart
shoulders of some giant red man? Shall one doubt that the Pilgrim
gravity was for a moment dispelled, when the Indians approached
with their delicious contribution to the feast? Can't we hear the
welcoming cheer that arose from the throats of those Englishmen, or
the clapping of the hands of the younger women as those Indian athletes
entered the camp? It is also recorded that from their Indian
guests the Pilgrims received clams, oysters, fish and vegetables. What
a feast this must have been!</p>

<p>The warriors remained with the Pilgrims for several days, and
contended with them in various games or feats of strength and agility.
Perhaps Massasoit unbent from his kingly dignity to show how
straight he could send an arrow at some improvised target. Maybe
some Puritan maiden laughingly tried her hand on an Indian bow.
Possibly, too, in the military drill which Miles Standish with his
famous regiment of twenty gave, there was intention on the part of
the stout little warrior to show the Indian what a formidable foe the
white man might be if provoked. At any rate, the friendship, hallowed
by thanksgiving hospitality, continued unbroken for nearly half
a century.</p>

<p>What a noble, inspiring picture is the history of this first Thanksgiving
Day&mdash;a picture of piety, of human brotherhood, and of poetry,
for which the universal heart of man, when realizing its profound
significance, must gladly and proudly give thanks.</p>

<p>For many years this autumnal "feast of ingathering" was merely an
occasional festival, as unexpected prosperity or hoped for aid in adversity
moved our Pilgrim fathers to a special act of praise. It was not
until after the Revolutionary War that this day took on a national significance.
George Washington issued the first proclamation in 1795.
This will be read by many with deep interest, especially in view of
the fact that some persons believe that a national Thanksgiving
proclamation is a recent invention in our country. After this date it
was only occasionally observed until 1863. It was our Civil War
which awakened our national conscience, and since that time every
President of the United States has issued a Thanksgiving Proclamation,
which has in turn been issued to the different states by their
respective governors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Thanksgiving is a universal holiday; it is for all the people. As
heretofore, each year brings new households, enlarged families, increased
affections, comfortable homes, plentiful tables, abundant harvests,
a beneficent government, free schools, and religious liberty.
There is much to be grateful for in our national history. Whatever
may have been our sense of past duty, it is the privilege of all to
thank God that He has given us the unexpected and unsought for
opportunity to relieve much oppression and to extend the blessings of
good government and fair freedom to many millions of people.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful opportunity, and no people on the face of the
globe have a stricter sense of duty than our great country. We may
be far from perfect if tried by the highest standards, but where shall
we find a nation which less desires to rule, and desires to rule more
justly, giving liberty to all? We as a generation have lived to see
what may be the greatest epoch in the world's history. Truly the
seeds of this harvest were sown years ago by our Pilgrim fathers. For
such mercies what soul will not raise its thanksgiving to God? Let
us as teachers of the state of New Jersey teach our children these
great truths, and enter with an open mind and a willing heart into
each Thanksgiving festival, and let us all try to inculcate in the hearts
of our pupils this significant brotherhood.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE FESTIVAL COMMITTEE</p>

<p>Let the history of this great Thanksgiving Feast be the background
and setting for your play-festival. Let it be the duty of teachers to
see that the program for this celebration is inspired by patriotism, by
a reverence for God, who has been most gracious to us as a people.
For social reasons, it will be well to let some particular grade prepare
the program for the festival. The other grades of the school will be
in the audience, and thus the whole school will be united into one
large social group. Before it is decided which grade shall be selected
to prepare the program the principal and teachers should meet and,
after talking over the preliminary plans, appoint the festival committee.
It is important that the proper kind of machinery for this
festival work be constructed. It will be the duty of this special committee
to keep in mind such objects of the play-festival as the promotion
of a keener appreciation and a more reverent remembrance of
great events and great men and women of our history; the promotion
of a deep national patriotism; the promotion of a sense of deep gratitude
that we live in such a bountiful and beautiful earth. The play-festival
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
should be looked upon as a means of moral, social, cultural
and esthetic education.</p>

<p>Keeping these things in mind, the play-festival should be invented
almost entirely by the children, who will present the program. Of
course this will require the watchful guidance of teachers and committee.
A play or program that has been already planned for the
occasion may be taken, but even in such a program the scenes should
be planned by the class. If this plan is followed almost any of the
ready-made plays may be adapted for any grade from the kindergarten
to the high school. The wealth of historic material which
readily conforms to the Thanksgiving program is abundant. There
is no school that cannot act some scene, pantomime, tableau or the
like, with but little thought and drill. The results obtained by
bringing any class in touch with some of our masterpieces of history,
literature, art, music, or sculpture, cannot be easily estimated.</p>


<p class="caption3">PREPARING THE PROGRAM</p>

<p>A good method of preparing the program is to bring before the
class who has been decided upon to render the festival the fact that
this grade has been appointed to do this bit of patriotic service. Tell
them about the festival, its simple aims; about the historic material
on which the day is founded. Have the pupils write their ideas
about developing the program. These may be discussed, and the
best suggestions can be used about which to form an outline. This
is admirable training for the pupils. Not infrequently surprises
occur; unsuspected talents are discovered; and often the children
who have appeared as dullards in them regular school subjects will
take an interest which will lead to salutary results. Many times
children will enjoy working on such plans and develop a new interest
in their studies. The children should also be asked for suggestions
as to developing the stage scenery, costumes, etc. Frequently
their suggestions, with slight modifications, have an effectiveness
beyond the reach of the teacher. Of course we as teachers
must be satisfied with rather crude suggestions, and work up to a
satisfactory result.</p>

<p>The stage setting should always be simple, but suggestive. Often
a play-festival may be rendered with little or no scenery. In fact,
most of our present school programs are given without even a semblance
of scenery or decorations. Some simple stage setting, scenery,
or decorations will add wonderfully to the effect of your program, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
this will be found easy to accomplish. This is particularly true of the
Thanksgiving Day program. In the rural districts, especially, can be
found the proper materials for this day. Such things as cornstalks,
pumpkins, apples, fruits, cereals, and vegetables of many kinds will
meet your needs. Whatever is good for a harvest home celebration
may be used to celebrate Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>It is desirable, also, to have simple costumes. The teacher should
not be burdened with the making of the costumes. Arouse the interest
of your class, and they will take home this interest. The result
will be that the teacher will get more than he had hoped or suggested.</p>

<p>The work of preparing the music should be done during the period
of the day when singing is usually done. The music is very valuable.
The whole school appreciates music and singing. It is the one unifying
influence within the reach of the school. If all the various classes
are used to promote the play-festival a practical correlation of the
work of the school may be profitably accomplished.</p>


<p class="caption3">THE PROGRAM</p>

<p>Below is submitted a type program for the Thanksgiving Day
Festival. This is suitable for fifth and sixth grade pupils. This type
of program may be easily changed so that it may be rendered by pupils
of the first grade or by students of the high school. Care should always
be exercised that the plan of the program is easily understood
by the class who renders it. Scenes should be molded to meet the
needs and capacities of the grade that is to perform. The dialog or
monolog should also be adapted to the ages of the pupils who are
to do the acting. Below will be found a list of scenes which by
thoughtful manipulation may be made to fall within the command of
pupils from the kindergarten to the high school. The bibliography
given will furnish much information.</p>

<p class="caption2">LINCOLN'S BIRTHDAY</p>

<p class="caption3">CHARLES A. PHILHOWER, SUPERVISING PRINCIPAL, WESTFIELD</p>


<p>The observance of Lincoln's birthday as a national holiday has
grown steadily until twenty-four states have designated it by statute
as a holiday. The great emancipator is today our foremost national
hero. His most unusual career from the log cabin to the White House
sets ambition and hope of attainment before the most lowly and the
most favorably environed alike.</p>

<p>There are many salient reasons why the boys and girls of our schools
should study the life of this great hero. He established once and
for all time the now inalienable right of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness to all mankind. Early in life he was dubbed by his
friends and neighbors with the enviable title of "Honest Abe." On
the frontier we find him inuring himself to toil. He was thoroughly
acquainted with that slogan always necessary to success, "hard work."
His life was pure, untainted with the vices which spring from luxury,
the lust for gain, the greed for fame. Simple in living, steadfast in
purpose, kindly in spirit, he towered among his fellows, exemplary
of that manhood toward which all boys who would be of worth to
mankind should aspire.</p>

<p>At the present time it is especially opportune that Lincoln's birthday
be celebrated most impressively. The freedom for which we have
just been fighting is a greater freedom than that of '61. That was
for the freedom of the slave, this for a greater freedom of men already
free; that was freedom for a part of mankind, this a freedom for all,
for the democracy of the world. The principles for which he stood
are the principles for which we must ever stand, but the application
of those principles is limitless in its scope. It is for us to see that
those who have sacrificed their lives in this great cause shall not have
died in vain. It is for the boys and girls in our schools today to
carry to a successful issue this great project of making the world safe
for democracy and democracy safe for the world, and no small part
of this work lies on our shoulders as teachers of boys and girls who
will be citizens tomorrow.</p>

<p>The law requires that on the last school day preceding Lincoln's
birthday appropriate exercises be held for the development of a high
spirit of patriotism. The whole day should center around the life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of Lincoln. For the afternoon a special program should be prepared
and the parents of the school children invited by special letters
written by the pupils of the school. The pupils of each school should
assist in working out the program. In some schools, in the upper
grades the pupils should be held responsible for much of the work in
program making. Each teacher and principal should arrange the
work of the day and the special program to one end, that of utilizing
the great spirit and profound wisdom of a wonderful man to the
establishment of a greater patriotism and the working out of the
national problems before us.</p>

<p>The following general suggestions indicate the important factors
to be considered in making a Lincoln program.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Point out the significance of the flag salute</p>

<p>Analyze the pledge</p>

<p>Sing patriotic songs</p>

<p class="ind30">
  The songs of today<br />
  The songs of the past<br />
</p>

<p>Study Lincoln's boyhood. His career from the log cabin to the White
House is phenomenal</p>

<p>Lincoln the lawyer and politician</p>

<p>Emphasize the work and honesty in the life of Abraham Lincoln</p>

<p>President of the United States and statesman. His great speeches</p>

<p>Read, study and memorize the Gettysburg speech. Each child should
have a copy</p>

<p>Learn quotations, and know their meaning and application</p>

<p>Collect a number of pictures of Lincoln</p>

<p>Call special attention to the best statuary</p>

<p>Gutzon Borglum's Lincoln before the Court House in Newark, New
Jersey, and the statue by Saint Gaudens in Lincoln Park, Chicago,
are the most worthy and should be particularly noted</p>

<p>"O Captain, My Captain," by Whitman, and "The Perfect Tribute,"
by Mary Shipman Andrews, should be read by the teacher</p>

<p>Do not neglect the great humor in his life; children enjoy a joke</p>

<p>Pupils will enjoy writing acrostics on the name of Lincoln</p>

<p>The Lincoln Highway and the National Lincoln Memorial are recent
monuments to the honor of this great man</p>

<p>Let the decorations of the room be in keeping with the celebration</p>

<p>Lincoln posters may be made in the drawing class</p>

<p>The younger pupils will be interested in collecting the stamps with
Lincoln's picture</p>

<p>Civil War veterans, Civil War pictures, Civil War newspapers, Civil
War correspondence, will make vital contributions in vivifying the
life of Lincoln, incidents of the War, and this special observance.
Invite veterans to come in and make brief speeches. Request
pupils to bring old newspapers, old correspondence, war relics and
the like with the assurance that they will be cared for and safely
returned</p>

kind may continue for the whole week.</p>
</div>


<p class="caption3">SUGGESTIONS FOR USE OF THE MATERIAL WHICH FOLLOWS</p>

<p>Preparatory to the observance of Lincoln's birthday teach carefully
and thoroughly the Gettysburg Speech. Each pupil from the fifth
grade through the high school ought to know this great masterpiece.
Teach the occasion on which it was given, which brought forth this
great production, the significance of the speech then and now, and
finally have each child give it from memory. A contest in the delivery
of Lincoln's Gettysburg Speech would interest the school and the
public. The winner should appear on the holiday program.</p>

<p>The placing in schools of Lincoln Memorial Bronze Tablets containing
the Gettysburg Speech will give special significance to the
observance. This practice should be promoted. Every new school
should have its Lincoln Memorial Tablet.</p>

<p>The most interesting persons in the eyes of children are children.
They are most concerned with what kind of a boy Lincoln was. Books
such as "Life of Abraham Lincoln for Boys and Girls," by C. W.
Moores, and "The Boy's Life of Abraham Lincoln," by J. G. Nicolay,
should be made available. Pupils should be encouraged to tell to the
class what they have found of interest in the accounts of his boyhood.
Incidents of his honesty, his desire for learning, and habit of hard
work, will be brought forth and no effort should be spared to emphasize
these most important characteristics. Strive for enthusiastic admiration,
and the imitation of these most desirable qualities will
follow.</p>

<p>Stories from his life, incidents in his experience, and periods in
his career, such as the twenty-two years on the farm, the twenty-seven
years in intellectual pursuits, and the seven years in national service,
will give profitable material for work in English. Oral and written
reproductions should be taught for some time before the holiday observance
and the best of these used on this occasion. Mr. Judd Stewart's
suggestions (given on another page) respecting the study of
Lincoln's English are very valuable.</p>

<p>Give an exercise or two in acrostic writing with the aim of setting
forth in a succinct way his admirable character and laudable accomplishments.
A problem of this type appeals to children and has value
in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The humorous stories of Lincoln should not be neglected. There
is great need for high standards of humor, jokes and jests with boys
and girls. Every one should be able to tell a good story well. The
humor in Lincoln's life presents good material for such teaching.</p>

<p>A study and memorizing of quotations may be begun early in the
fall; in fact, such study should be pursued throughout the whole
school course. If this is done many pupils will be able to give on
February twelfth their choice from among Lincoln's sayings with
reasons for their selections and with statements respecting the source
of their admiration. Every pupil should have a stock of Lincoln
sayings at his command. These selected thoughts should be a part
of the thinking of boys and girls.</p>

<p>Readings for the week preceding the holiday observance can be
made from the following brief publications:</p>

<p class="ind30">
  "Lincoln Centenary Ode," Percy MacKaye<br />
  "Commemorative Ode," James Russell Lowell<br />
  "Abraham Lincoln," Carl Schurz<br />
  "Abraham Lincoln," George Bancroft<br />
  "The Perfect Tribute," Mary Shipman Andrews<br />
</p>

<p>The selections should be read in their entirety, in most cases by
the teacher to the class. If there is a pupil who is a very good reader,
such a pupil may do it effectively. Each school library ought to have
a good selection of Lincolnia from which the pupils could draw books
for outside reading. Books such as these should be read by the class
supplemental to the study of the Civil War period.</p>

<p>A good teacher is able to read well "O Captain, My Captain," and
she reads it often to her pupils. Ultimately the children will get the
spirit of the poem and some will be able to read it well or give it
from memory. The various poems herein mentioned are worthy of
similar treatment.</p>

<p>As the Gettysburg Speech is studied, so should the Civil War songs
be studied. The "Battle Hymn of the Republic" should be sung with
all the feeling which its meaning is capable of conveying. As much
should be done with "Tenting on the Old Camp Ground." The allusion
here is very impressive. The sentiment is the song, the tune
is a mode of expression.</p>

<p>Each school in the state should have a picture of Lincoln. It
should be hung by the pupils where it can be seen by the youngest as
well as the oldest. A child does well in having a definite acquaintance
with the rugged, kindly face of Lincoln. A look at this picture should
give renewed emphasis to his standards of living and the great principles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
which he established. Not long since a teacher said to me,
"When I have a case of discipline where the pupil has difficulty in
getting the right point of view I often say to the boy, especially if
he be of the upper grades, 'Go out into the hall and look for a few
minutes at the fatherly face of the great Lincoln and then come back
to me and tell me what you think he would say in this case.'" Such
procedure is extremely effective, particularly when the pupil is acquainted
with Lincoln's sayings and the great principles for which
he stood. Marshall's "Lincoln" is a fine portrait for schools.</p>

<p>The decoration of the classroom will present demands for drawing
and handwork activities such as picture frames, draperies, red, white
and blue chains, and flag decorations. Much can be done in the
making of posters with water colors and crayons, in the artistic ornamentation
of Lincoln picture mounts on drawing paper, and in the
lettering and decoration of Lincoln acrostics. The use of Lincoln
picture cutouts; the drawing or painting of flags, the state seal and
shields, the American eagle; perspective drawings of the log cabin,
the White House and the Capitol are suggested activities. Postage
stamps containing Lincoln's picture may be used in connection with
handwork and drawing activities. Booklets for acrostics, anecdotes,
quotations, brief biography or history incidents, with appropriate cover
design, initial letters and simple illustrations will afford attractive
and profitable projects.</p>

<p>Many other ways and means of presenting the life of Lincoln will
suggest themselves to the active, thinking teacher. The whole object
is to help boys and girls to know Lincoln as he lived, to make his life
function in making their lives better and more worth while through
his great thoughts, high ideals and indefatigable spirit of work.</p>

<p>The following programs, selections, suggestions and bibliography are
intended to make available some selected material which in many
cases may not be accessible.</p>

<p class="caption3">GETTYSBURG SPEECH</p>

<p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent
a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We
have come to dedicate a portion of it as the final resting-place of those
who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether
fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>

<p>But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate&mdash;we cannot consecrate&mdash;we
cannot hallow&mdash;this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or
detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here,
but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather,
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here
have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us&mdash;that from these honored dead we
take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full
measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall
not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new
birth of freedom; and that the government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Abraham Lincoln</i><br /></p>


<p class="caption3">SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS</p>

<p>[Lincoln's ideas respecting the injustice of the principles of slavery
and the honesty of purpose in waging the Civil War are set forth in the
Second Inaugural Speech. This passage is probably the most beautiful,
the most chaste, the most profound, the grandest, ever uttered by an
American.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Fellow-countrymen: At this second appearing to take the oath of the
presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than
there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail, of a course
to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four
years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth
on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention
and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could
be presented.</p>

<p>The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as
well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory
and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction
in regard to it is ventured.</p>

<p>On the occasion corresponding to this, four years ago, all thoughts were
anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it; all sought
to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this
place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent
agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war&mdash;seeking to dissolve
the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.</p>

<p>Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather
than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than
let it perish. And the war came.</p>

<p>The prayer of both could not be answered&mdash;those of neither have been
answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. "Woe unto the
world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but
woe to that man by whom the offense cometh."</p>

<p>If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses
which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having
continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that
He gives to North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those
by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from
those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe
to Him?</p>

<p>Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of
war may soon pass away.</p>

<p>Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the
bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk,
and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it
must be said, "The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."</p>

<p>With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work
we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall
have borne the battle, and for his widow and for his orphan; to do all
which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves,
and with all nations.</p>

<p class="caption3">ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</p>

<p>The following autobiography was written by Mr. Lincoln's own
hand at the request J. W. Fell, of Springfield, Illinois, December 20,
1859. In the note which accompanied it the writer says: "Herewith
is a little sketch, as you requested. There is not much of it, for the
reason, I suppose, that there is not much of me."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I was born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My
parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families&mdash;second
families, perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year,
was of a family of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside in
Adams County, and others in Mason County, Illinois. My paternal grand-father,
Abraham Lincoln, emigrated from Rockingham County, Virginia,
to Kentucky, about 1781 or 1782, where, a year or two later, he was killed
by Indians, not in battle, but by stealth, when he was laboring to open a
farm in the forest. His ancestors, who were Quakers, went to Virginia
from Berks County, Pennsylvania. An effort to identify them with the
New England family of the same name ended in nothing more definite
than a similarity of Christian names in both families, such as Enoch,
Levi, Mordecai, Solomon, Abraham, and the like.</p>

<p>My father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age, and grew
up literally without any education. He removed from Kentucky to what
is now Spencer County, Indiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new
home about the time the state came into the Union. It was a wild region,
with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods. There I
grew up. There were some schools, so called, but no qualification was
ever required of a teacher beyond readin', writin' and cipherin' to the
rule of three. If a straggler, supposed to understand Latin, happened to
sojourn in the neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There was
absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education. Of course, when I
came of age I did not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write,
and cipher to the rule of three, but that was all. I have not been to
school since. The little advance I now have upon this store of education
I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity.</p>

<p>I was raised to farm work, at which I continued till I was twenty-two.
At twenty-one I came to Illinois, and passed the first year in Macon
County. Then I got to New Salem, at that time in Sangamon, now
Menard County, where I remained a year as a sort of clerk in a store.
Then came the Black Hawk War, and I was elected a captain of volunteers&mdash;a
success which gave me more pleasure than any I have had since.
I went into the campaign, was elected, ran for the Legislature the same
year (1832), and was beaten&mdash;the only time I have ever been beaten by
the people. The next and three succeeding biennial elections I was
elected to the Legislature. I was not a candidate afterward. During the
legislative period I had studied law, and removed to Springfield, to practice
it. In 1846 I was elected to the Lower House of Congress. Was not
a candidate for reelection. From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive, practiced
law more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in politics, and
generally on the Whig electoral ticket, making active canvasses. I was
losing interest in politics when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise
aroused me again. What I have done since then is pretty well known.</p>

<p>If any personal description of me is thought desirable, it may be said
I am in height six feet four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an
average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse
black hair and gray eyes&mdash;no other marks or brands recollected.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE BIXBY LETTER</p>

<p class="tdr">Executive Mansion, Washington, November 21, 1864<br /></p>

<p class="tdl">Dear Madam:</p>

<p>I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of
the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts, that you are the mother of five
sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel how weak and
fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you
from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering
to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic
they have died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage
the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to
have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.</p>

<p class="tdr">
Yours, very sincerely and respectfully<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Abraham Lincoln</span></p>

<p class="caption3">SAYINGS FROM LINCOLN'S SPEECHES</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Let us have faith that right makes might; and in that faith let us, to
the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.</p>

<p>I intend no modification of my oft-expressed wish that all men everywhere
should be free.</p>

<p>A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government
cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.</p>

<p>I take the official oath today with no mental reservation and with no
purpose to construe the constitution by any hypercritical rules.</p>

<p>You can have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government;
while I shall have the most solemn one to "preserve, protect and defend"
it.</p>

<p>The mystic chords of memory stretching from every battle-field and
patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad
land, will yet swell the chorus of Union, when again touched, as surely
they will be, by the better angels of our nature.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In giving freedom to the slaves we assure freedom to the free&mdash;honorable
alike in what we give and what we preserve.</p>

<p>Do not swap horses in the middle of the stream.</p>

<p>You can fool part of the people all of the time, and all of the people
part of the time; but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.</p>

<p>I do not think much of a man who is not wiser today than he was
yesterday.</p>

<p>The leading rule for the man of every calling is diligence; never put
off until tomorrow what you can do today.</p>

<p>I never let an idea escape, but write it on a piece of paper and put it in
a drawer. In this way I sometimes save my best thoughts on a subject.</p>

<p>Wealth is a superfluity of what we do not need.</p>

<p>Come what will, I will keep faith with friend and foe.</p>

<p>Faith in God is indispensable to successful statesmanship.</p>

<p>God bless my mother; all I am or hope to be I owe to her.</p>

<p>I will study and get ready and maybe my chance will come.</p>

<p>Be sure you put your feet in the right place and then stand firm.</p>

<p>And having thus chosen our course, without guile and with pure purpose,
let us renew our trust in God, and go forward without fear and
with manly hearts.</p>

<p>Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.</p>

<p>It is all in that one word&mdash;thorough.</p>

<p>Let us strive on to finish the work we are in.</p>

<p>When you can't remove an obstacle plow around it.</p>

<p>The way for a young man to rise is to improve every way he can, never
suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him.</p>

<p>To add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of Washington is
alike impossible. Let none attempt it. In solemn awe pronounce the
name and in its naked deathless splendor leave it shining on.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE BOY THAT HUNGERED FOR KNOWLEDGE</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In his eagerness to acquire knowledge, young Lincoln had borrowed of
Mr. Crawford, a neighboring farmer, a copy of Weems' Life of Washington&mdash;the
only one known to be in existence in that section of the country.
Before he had finished reading the book, it had been left, by a not unnatural
oversight, in a window. Meantime, a rain storm came on, and the
book was so thoroughly wet as to make it nearly worthless. This mishap
caused him much pain; but he went, in all honesty, to Mr. Crawford with
the ruined book, explained the calamity that had happened through his
neglect, and offered, not having sufficient money, to "work out" the value
of the book.</p>

<p>"Well, Abe," said Mr. Crawford, after due deliberation, "as it's you, I
won't be hard on you. Just come over and pull fodder for me for two
days, and we will call our accounts even."</p>

<p>The offer was readily accepted, and the engagement literally fulfilled.
As a boy, no less than since, Abraham Lincoln had an honorable conscientiousness,
integrity, industry, and an ardent love of knowledge.</p>
</div>


<p class="caption3">ABE LINCOLN'S HONESTY</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Lincoln could not rest for an instant under the consciousness that he
had, even unwittingly, defrauded anybody. On one occasion, while clerking
in Offutt's store, at New Salem, Illinois, he sold a woman a little bill of
goods, amounting in value by the reckoning, to two dollars six and a quarter
cents. He received the money, and the woman went away. On adding
the items of the bill again, to make sure of its correctness, he found that,
he had taken six and a quarter cents too much. It was night and closing
and locking the store, he started out on foot, a distance of two or three
miles, for the house of his defrauded customer, and, delivering over to her
the sum whose possession had so much troubled him, went home satisfied.</p>

<p>On another occasion, just as he was closing the store for the night, a
woman entered, and asked for a half pound of tea. The tea was weighed
out and paid for, and the store was left for the night. The next morning,
Lincoln entered to begin the duties of the day, when he discovered a four-ounce
weight on the scales. He saw at once that he had made a mistake,
and, shutting the store, he took a long walk before breakfast to deliver the
remainder of the tea. These are very humble incidents, but they illustrate
the man's perfect conscientiousness&mdash;his sensitive honesty&mdash;better perhaps
than they would if they were of greater moment.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3">YOUNG LINCOLN'S KINDNESS OF HEART</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>An instance of young Lincoln's practical humanity at an early period of
his life is recorded, as follows:</p>

<p>One evening, while returning from a "raising" in his wide neighborhood,
with a number of companions, he discovered a straying horse, with saddle
and bridle upon him. The horse was recognized as belonging to a man
who was accustomed to excess in drink, and it was suspected at once that
the owner was not far off. A short search only was necessary to confirm
the suspicions of the young men.</p>

<p>The poor drunkard was found in a perfectly helpless condition, upon the
chilly ground. Abraham's companions urged the cowardly policy of leaving
him to his fate, but young Lincoln would not hear to the proposition.
At his request, the miserable sot was lifted to his shoulders, and he actually
carried him eighty rods to the nearest house. Sending word to his
father that he should not be back that night, with the reason for his absence,
he attended and nursed the man until the morning, and had the
pleasure of believing that he had saved his life.</p>
</div>


<p class="caption3">A BIT OF HUMOR FROM THE BUSY LIFE OF LINCOLN</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Two persons who had been arguing with each other how long a man's
legs should be in proportion to his body, stepped into Lincoln's office and
asked him to settle the dispute.</p>

<p>To them he replied: "After much thought and consideration, not to
mention mental worry and anxiety, it is my opinion, all side issues being
swept aside, that a man's lower limbs, in order to preserve harmony of
proportion, should be at least long enough to reach from his body to the
ground."</p>
</div>


<p class="caption3">HOW LINCOLN AND JUDGE B. ... SWAPPED HORSES</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>When Abraham Lincoln was a lawyer in Illinois, he and a certain judge
once got to bantering each other about trading horses, and it was agreed
that the next morning at nine o'clock they should make a trade, the horses
to be unseen up to that hour, and no backing out, under a forfeiture of $25.</p>

<p>At the hour appointed the Judge came up, leading the sorriest-looking
specimen of a horse ever seen in those parts. In a few minutes Mr. Lincoln
was seen approaching with a wooden sawhorse upon his shoulders.
Great were the shouts and the laughter of the crowd, and both were greatly
increased when Mr. Lincoln, on surveying the Judge's animal, set down his
sawhorse, and exclaimed: "Well, Judge, this is the first time I ever got
the worst of it in a horse trade."</p>
</div>

<p>The following paragraphs are quoted from a small pamphlet of
Mr. Judd Stewart of Plainfield, New Jersey, entitled "Suggestions for
a Text Book for Students of English." Mr. Stewart is a profound
student of Lincoln, and without doubt has the largest private collection
of Lincolnia in the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It was recently suggested to me by a lieutenant in the navy, a graduate
of Annapolis, that in teaching English the writings and speeches of Lincoln
would be a very proper text-book. This appeals to me most forcefully
because all school children know who Lincoln was, know something of his
Gettysburg Address, know him as the Emancipator of the Slaves and probably
a majority of them admire him. Therefore, it seems to me that a
text-book based upon, or rather made up from Lincoln's speeches and
letters would be of great interest to the majority of children, and by
having such a text-book they would learn history and good expressive
English at the same time and in a most interesting way.</p>

<p>The suggested text-book would consist of: The House Divided Against
Itself Speech, in 1858; The First Debate with Douglas Speech in 1858;
The Cooper Institute Speech, 1860; The First Inaugural, 1861; The First
Message to Congress, 1861; The Emancipation Proclamation, 1863; The
Gettysburg Address, 1863; The Letter to Mrs. Bixby, 1864; The Second
Inaugural, 1865.</p>

<p>Lincoln spent 49 years of his life in preparation, six years in the accomplishment
of his work. The study of his life is commended and commends
itself to all thinking people.</p>

<p>Why should we not teach his thoughts, his modes of speech, his simplicity
of expression to those who with their children and descendants for
ages will remember Abraham Lincoln, the Emancipator, the Martyr, the
Greatest American?</p>
</div>

<p>Attention should be given to the great statue of Lincoln before the
Court House in Newark, New Jersey. It presents our most admired
statesman seated on a bench absorbed in thought. The statue is a
wonderful work of art. From every angle it is unique, beautiful, and
a masterpiece. At all times of day passersby may see the children of
the city sitting in his arm, lovingly admiring the fatherly face. On
his knees and on the bench they gather, children of all races, rejoicing
in the freedom which he gave to mankind.</p>

<p>The statue was conceived and made by the Sculptor Gutzon Borglum,
for Amos H. VanHorn, the donor. It was presented to the Lincoln
Post on May 30, 1911, by Chancellor Mahlon Pitney. Colonel Theodore
Roosevelt received it in behalf of the Post, and Mayor Husaling
made the speech of acceptance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Pass on, thou that hast overcome. Your sorrows, O people, are his
peace. Your bells and bands and muffled drums sound triumph in his ear.
Wail and weep here; God made it echo joy and triumph there. Pass on.</p>

<p>Four years ago, O Illinois, we took from your midst an untried man, and
from amongst the people. We return him to you a mighty conqueror. Not
thine any more, but the Nation's; not ours, but the world's. Give him
place, O ye prairies. In the midst of this great continent his dust shall
rest, a sacred treasure to myriads who shall pilgrim to that shrine to
kindle anew their zeal and patriotism. Ye winds that move over the
mighty places of the West, chant his requiem. Ye people, behold a martyr
whose blood as so many articulate words, pleads for fidelity, for law, for
liberty.</p>

<p class="caption2">WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY</p>

<p class="caption3">HENRY W. FOSTER, SUPERVISING PRINCIPAL, SOUTH ORANGE</p>


<p>February is the greatest month for the teaching of patriotism. The
national heroes, Washington and Lincoln, whose birthdays we celebrate,
give distinction to two of its days. The time falls happily in
midyear, when pupils and teachers alike need inspiration for a new
period of sustained effort requiring determination and vigor.</p>

<p>It has been shown very clearly that through its schools a nation
can be trained in ideals which will govern national life and conduct.
Neither Washington nor Lincoln, however, owed his heroic quality to
schools; but they did owe it to the very same ideals for which our
schools stand. Indeed, their greatest service to mankind is the fact
that they incarnated those ideals.</p>

<p>It is not so easy to venerate abstract principles and to submit one's
life to them as it is to imitate great personalities whose deeds have
embodied those principles.</p>

<p>Because we love our national heroes and venerate them personally,
they still live and work through us. The principles of democracy are
established eternally in their deeds and in ours.</p>

<p>The child who writes an appreciation of Washington, or recites
from his addresses, or renders a poem commemorating him, or dramatizes
something from his life, enters into his spirit, and in the child
Washington lives again.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence asserts the lofty principle of
equality in liberty. All men are created free, and equal in the right to
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is a declaration of
rights, not of duties. Each person has a right to <i>his</i> life, <i>his</i> liberty,
the pursuit of <i>his</i> happiness. The deeds of Washington embodied not
only these principles, but emphasized the duty of service. In our
time our country has fully justified a new statement of political faith,
which Washington lived. All men are born equal in the right to
opportunity&mdash;each to make the best of himself&mdash;so that he may render
the best service.</p>

<p>Think not of the reward! On the whole, service is requited according
to its worth. Too many want to do what they can't do, and
won't do what they can do! It may be pride, or it may be looking for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
an undeserved reward. The school should train for service, and teach
self-respect in doing the best that one can in the thing for which he
is best fitted. Washington sought no reward; but he commands the
undying veneration, not only of his countrymen, but of all mankind.
Speaking of the retirement of Washington, at a time when party
spirit against the policy of the great founder and preserver of the
Republic was calculated to arouse bitterness in a less noble man,
Knight, in his "History of England," says: "Had his nature been
different, had his ambition been less under the control of his virtue,
he might have taken up his sword and, sweeping away his enemy, have
raised himself to supreme power upon the ruins of his country's
liberty. He retired to his estate at Mount Vernon to pass the rest
of his days as a private citizen.... Washington's scheme of
glory was realized. He had been a ruler of free men, ruling by the
power of law. He laid down his authority when he had done the
work to which he was called, most happy in this, that ambitions of
a selfish order could never be justified by his example."</p>

<p>Washington's point of view as a ruler of men was unique at that
period in the world's history.</p>

<p>We need to teach from the life of Washington that same respect for
English ideals of government which he maintained and defended,
even by revolting against the English king. Too many of our people
have grown up in hatred of England, through the story of the Revolution
and the War of 1812, and the unfortunate attitude of aristocratic
England in our Civil War.</p>

<p>How does England, the heart and brain of England, regard us? If
we know that she sympathizes with our ideals and her heart has been
with us all the time, shall we not feel safe with her, and find in
Englishmen brothers with whom we may work for the good of the
world?</p>

<p>English historians have an appreciation of Washington which we
cannot surpass. Writing English history for the instruction of English
boys and girls, and men and women, they justify our Revolution
and laud our national hero as a world hero. No American orator
has ever magnified Washington in more laudatory terms than are to
be found in Green's "History of England." Green says: "Washington
more than any of his fellow colonists represented the clinging of
the Virginia land owner to the Mother Country, and his acceptance
of the command proved that even the most moderate of them had no
hope now save in arms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>For the future we shall need a better understanding of our English
brothers. This cannot better be attained than by knowing well that
our ideals are held in the same regard by them as by ourselves.</p>

<p>There was one man who was the chief instrument in the hands of
Providence for conducting the war, by his energy, prudence, and constancy,
to that triumphant assertion of Independence which has built
up the great North American republic. To Washington the historian
naturally turns, as to the grandest object of contemplation, when he
laid aside his victorious sword&mdash;that sword which, with those he had
worn in his earlier career, he bequeathed to his nephews with words
characteristic of his nobleness: "These swords are accompanied with
an injunction not to unsheathe them for the purpose of shedding blood,
except it be for self-defence, or in defence of their Country and its
rights, and in the latter case to keep them unsheathed, and prefer
falling with them in their hands to the relinquishment thereof."</p>

<p>The United Colonies in America had such a man as Washington
to control the destinies of our country in the making. The new nation
had such a man for a leader during the early years of trial and
promise. The nation today has the records, accomplishments and
deeds of the national hero, Washington, to ever honor, venerate and
imitate. The school children of the great state of New Jersey should
be happy to learn from the life of this great man lessons of service,
respect for law and order, truthfulness and patriotism.</p>


<p class="caption3">QUOTATIONS</p>

<p>According to Captain Mercer, the following describes Washington
when he took his seat in the House of Burgesses in 1759:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"He is as straight as an Indian, measuring six feet two inches in his
stockings, and weighing one hundred and seventy-five pounds. His head
is well shaped, though not large, and is gracefully poised on a superb
neck, with a large, and straight rather than prominent nose; blue-gray
penetrating eyes, which are widely separated and overhung by heavy
brows. A pleasing, benevolent, though commanding countenance, dark-brown
hair, features regular and placid, with all the muscles under control,
with a large mouth, generally firmly closed."</p>
</div>

<p>Houdon's bust accords with this description.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the man of all men for whom his manly heart felt most tenderness,
to Lafayette, it is that he wrote the beautiful letter of February 1, 1784,
unaware that his rest was only temporary, and that he was to become
the first President of the country he had given life to:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"At length, my dear marquis, I am become a private citizen on the
banks of the Potomac, and under the shadow of my own vine and my own
fig-tree, free from the bustle of a camp and the busy scenes of public life,
I am solacing myself with those tranquil enjoyments of which the soldier
who is ever in pursuit of fame, the statesman whose watchful days and
sleepless nights are spent in devising schemes to promote the welfare of
his own, perhaps the ruin of other countries, as if the globe was insufficient
for us all ... can have very little conception. I have not
only retired from all public employments, but I am retiring within myself,
and shall be able to view the solitary walk of private life with heart-felt
satisfaction. Envious of none, I am determined to be pleased with
all; and this, my dear friend, being the order for my march, I will move
gently down the stream of life until I sleep with my fathers."</p>

<p>Among these men whose union in purpose and action made the strength
and stability of the republic, Washington was first, not only in the largeness
of his nature, the loftiness of his desires, and the vigor of his will,
but also in that representative quality which makes a man able to stand
as the true hero of a great people. He had an instinctive power to divine,
amid the confusions of rival interests and the cries of factional strife, the
new aims and hopes, the vital needs and aspirations, which were the
common inspiration of the people's cause and the creative forces of the
American nation. The power to understand this, the faith to believe in
it, and the unselfish courage to live for it, was the central factor of Washington's
life, the heart and fountain of his splendid Americanism.</p>

<span class="i0">"How did George Washington look?" asked Nell;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Washington one day came across a small band of soldiers working very
hard at raising some military works, under command of a pompous little
officer, who was issuing his orders in a peremptory style indeed.</p>

<p>Washington, seeing the very arduous task of the men, dismounted from
his horse, lent a helping hand, perspiring freely, till the weight at which
they were working was raised.</p>

<p>Then, turning to the officer, he inquired why he, too, had not helped,
and received the indignant reply: "Don't you know I'm the corporal?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said Washington, "next time your men are raising so heavy
a weight, send for your commander-in-chief." And he strode off, leaving
the corporal dumbfounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>An American sailor landing in England shortly after the close of
the War of the Revolution took a first-class seat in a stage coach,
but was told to get out, as such seats were reserved for gentlemen. "I am
a gentleman," said the sailor. "Who made gentlemen out of fellows like
you?" asked the coach guard. "George Washington," said the sailor; and
he kept his seat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No nobler figure ever stood in the forefront of a nation's life. Washington
was grave and courteous in address; his manners were simple
and unpretending, his silence and the serene calmness of his temper
spoke of a perfect self-mastery; but there was little in his outer bearing
to reveal the grandeur of soul which lifts his figure, with all the simple
majesty of an ancient statue, out of the smaller passions, the meaner
impulses of the world around him. What recommended him for command
was simply his weight among his fellow landowners of Virginia, and the
experience of war which he had gained by service in border contests with
the French and the Indians, as well as in Braddock's luckless expedition
against Fort Duquesne. It was only as the weary fight went on that the
colonists learned little by little the greatness of their leader, his clear
judgment, his heroic endurance, his silence under difficulties, his calmness
in the hour of danger or defeat, the patience with which he waited, the
quickness and hardness with which he struck, the lofty and serene sense
of duty that never swerved from its task through resentment or jealousy,
that never through war or peace felt the touch of a meaner ambition, that
knew no aim save that of guarding the freedom of his fellow countrymen,
and no personal longing save that of returning to his own fireside when
their freedom was secured. It was almost unconsciously that men learned
to cling to Washington with a trust and faith such as few other men have
won, and to regard him with a reverence which still hushes us in presence
of his memory. Even America hardly recognized his real greatness till
death set its seal on "the man first in war, first in peace, and first in the
hearts of his fellow countrymen."</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>J. R. Green</i><br /></p>

<p>Washington is the mightiest name on earth, long since mightiest in
the cause of civil liberty, still mightiest in moral reformation. On that
name a eulogy is expected. It cannot be. To add brightness to the sun
or glory to the name of Washington is alike impossible. Let none attempt
it. In solemn awe pronounce the name, and in its naked, deathless
splendor leave it shining on.</p>

<p>LIFE OF WASHINGTON<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>The story of George Washington's life has been often told, but it is
worth repeating. It was an active, busy life from his earliest days, beginning
as it did away back in Colonial times when the country was wild
and unsettled. Washington was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia,
in 1732. There is no reliable record of his early education, but it has
been supposed that the first school he ever attended was a little old field
school kept by one of his father's tenants, named Hobby, who was both
sexton and schoolmaster. Even at this early age George was fond of
playing at war. He used to divide his playmates into parties and armies.
One of them was called the French and the other American. A big boy
named William Bustle commanded the French, and George commanded
the Americans. Every day, with cornstalks for muskets and gourds for
drums, the two armies would turn out and march and fight.</p>

<p>George was not remarkable as a scholar, but he had a liking for mathematics.
He was of a more serious turn of mind than most boys of his
age. His last two years at school were devoted to engineering, geometry,
trigonometry, and surveying, and at sixteen years of age he was appointed
a public surveyor. His new employment brought him a handsome salary,
and well it might; for it took him into the perils and hardships of the
wilderness, often meeting savage chieftains, or fording swollen streams,
climbing rugged mountains, breasting furious storms, wading through
snowdrifts, sleeping in the open air, and living upon the coarse food of
hunters and of Indians. But everywhere he gained the admiration of the
backwoodsmen and the Indians by his manly bearing and his wonderful
endurance.</p>

<p>In the year 1751 the frontiers of the colony of Virginia were constantly
being attacked by the French and the Indians, so it was decided to divide
the colony into military districts under a major; and when he was but
nineteen, George Washington received one of these appointments. Two
years later he was sent to the French, who were becoming threatening,
to find out their intentions and to warn them against invading Virginian
territory. This important mission made it necessary for him to journey
six hundred miles through the wilderness; but he carried out his instructions
successfully, and traveled the whole distance without an
escort....</p>

<p>In 1755 George Washington served under the British officer, General
Braddock, showing great bravery under fire at the battle of Monongahela,
against the French and Indians, which would probably not have been lost
if the general had taken Washington's advice.</p>

<p>In 1759 Washington married a widow named Martha Custis, with two
children, John and Martha Parke Custis. He was a great favorite with
the two youngsters, and used to order toys, dolls, and gingerbreads for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
them from London. Mrs. Custis had a large estate and so had Washington,
and the management cf them took up all of his time.</p>

<p>When the disputes between England and the American colonies were
at their height, in 1774, he became a member of the First Continental
Congress, and the following year was chosen by that body Commander-in-Chief
of the Continental army. For this position his training and his
surveying experiences had thoroughly fitted him. He took command of
the troops at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 3, 1775; but it was a
poor army that he found under him. It was in want of arms, ammunition,
and general equipment. Washington, however, kept it together with
patience and skill during the trying years of the Revolution. The war
lasted six years and ended with the surrender of the British commander,
Cornwallis, at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781. During all this time Washington
had had to contend with the greatest difficulties. The troops were
poorly paid or equipped; often there were disputes among the officers,
and Congress did not know the army's needs; but the General always
kept the confidence of his men until victory was assured....</p>

<p>In 1783 Washington bade farewell to his army, and for the next six
years lived the simple life of a country gentleman on his estate at Mount
Vernon, attending to the affairs of his homestead and property.</p>

<p>In 1789 he was again called from private life, to become first president
of the United States. Congress was sitting at New York, for which city
he started, in April. He disliked fuss and ceremony, but the people
could not be restrained from showing their love and admiration. His
progress through New Jersey was amid constant cheering, ringing of
bells, and the booming of cannon. At Elizabethtown he embarked on a
splendid barge, followed by other barges and boats, making a long water
procession up the Bay of New York, the ships in the harbor being decorated
with colors, and firing salutes as it passed. The inauguration
took place on April 30, 1789, at the old City Hall, in Wall Street, Broad
Street being crowded with thousands of people as far as the eye could
reach. In 1793, he was re-elected for a second term of four years, after
which he bade farewell to the people and retired into private life. On
the 12th of December, 1799, he caught a severe cold in making the
round of his plantations and died two days later, in his sixty-eighth year.
In number of years he had not lived a long life, but how much was
crowded into it!</p>

<p>Most of the portraits of Washington show him as a serious-looking
gentleman in a wig, and the earliest biographies of him would lead us
to believe that he was always on his dignity. But our first president
was, in fact, a very genial man, with a hearty laugh, who enjoyed going
to the theater, was fond of fox-hunting and was a thorough sportsman,
and, as he himself admitted, had a hot temper. Towards young people
and children he was always very gracious and kind....</p>

<p>Like Lincoln, Washington was very athletic. Both of our two great
presidents were tall men: Washington was six feet two inches; Lincoln
was six feet four. When he first visited the Natural Bridge, in
Virginia, Washington threw a stone to the top, a distance of about two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
hundred feet, and, climbing the rocks, carved his name far above all
others....</p>

<p>In all the positions which he was called upon to fill, in his remarkable
life, whether as host at his home, as surveyor, as general, or as president,
Washington showed the same desire to give the best that was in
him for his people, his country, and for humanity at large. He endeared
himself to the lowly and he gained the admiration of the great. He
was never influenced by mean motives, and those who were under him
loved him. Thus it was that among Americans he came to be regarded
as "First in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen;"
and when his death became known on the other side of the Atlantic
Ocean, the armies of Napoleon in France, and the fleet of Great Britain,
his former enemy, did homage to his memory.</p>

<p>Washington's birthday was celebrated even during his lifetime, and
he had the satisfaction of receiving the congratulations of his fellow-citizens
many times upon the return of this day, frequently being a
guest at banquets given in honor of the occasion. In fact, after the
Revolution, Washington's birthday practically took the place of the
birthday of the various crowned heads of Great Britain, which had always
been celebrated with enthusiasm during colonial times. When independence
was established, all these royal birthdays were cast aside,
and the birthday of Washington naturally became one of the most
widely celebrated of American holidays....</p>

<p>Let us not forget what we owe to Washington, or make him merely
a name&mdash;an excuse for a holiday. Let us remember him as a real,
flesh and blood man&mdash;one of the greatest known to history.</p>

<p class="caption3">SELECTIONS FROM THE RULES OF CIVILITY</p>

<p class="caption3">(<i>Copied by Washington at the age of fourteen from an old translation
of a French book of 1595.</i>)</p>

<p>Show not yourself glad at the misfortune of another, though he were
your enemy.</p>

<p>When you see a crime punished you may be inwardly pleased; but
always show pity to the suffering offender.</p>

<p>Superfluous compliments and all affectation of ceremony are to be
avoided; yet, where due, they are not to be neglected.</p>

<p>When a man does all he can, though it succeed not well, blame not
him that did it.</p>

<p>Be not hasty to believe flying reports to the disparagement of any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate Nature,
rather than to procure admiration; keep to the fashion of your equals.</p>

<p>Associate yourself with men of good quality, if you esteem your own
reputation; for 'tis better to be alone than in bad company.</p>

<p>Speak not injurious words neither in jest nor in earnest; scoff at
none, although they give occasion.</p>

<p>Gaze not at the marks or blemishes of others, and ask not how they
came. What you may speak in secret to your friend, deliver not before
others.</p>

<p>Nothing but harmony, honest industry, and frugality are necessary
to make us a great people. First impressions are generally the most
lasting. It is therefore absolutely necessary, if you mean to make any
figure upon the stage, that you should take the first steps right.</p>

<p>There is a destiny which has the control of our actions not to be resisted
by the strongest efforts of Human Nature.</p>

<p>Let your heart feel for the afflictions and distresses of everyone, and
let your hand give in proportion to your purse; remembering always the
widow's mite, but that it is not everyone who asketh that deserveth
charity; all, however, are worthy the inquiry, or the deserving may
suffer.</p>

<p>I consider storms and victory under the direction of a wise Providence,
who no doubt directs them for the best purposes, and to bring
round the greatest degree of happiness to the greatest number.</p>

<p>Happiness depends more upon the internal frame of a person's mind,
than on the externals in the world.</p>

<p>To constitute a dispute there must be two parties. To understand it
well, both parties and all the circumstances must be fully heard; and
to accommodate differences, temper and mutual forbearance are requisite.</p>

<p>Idleness is disreputable under any circumstances; productive of no
good, even when unaccompanied by vicious habits.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon in prosperous gales to forget that adverse winds
blow.</p>

<p>Economy in all things is as commendable in the manager, as it is beneficial
and desirable to the employer.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate when men cannot or will not see danger at a distance;
or seeing it, are undetermined in the means which are necessary
to avert or keep it afar off.</p>

<p>Every man who is in the vigor of life ought to serve his country in
whatever line it requires, and he is fit for.</p>

<p>Rise early, that by habit it may become familiar, agreeable, healthy,
and profitable. It may, for a while, be irksome to do this, but that will
wear off; and the practice will produce a rich harvest forever thereafter,
whether in public or in private walks of life.</p>

<p>The propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation
that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself
has ordained.</p>

<p>The very idea of the power and right of the people to establish government
presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established
government.</p>

<p>If there was the same propensity in mankind for investigating the
motives, as there is for censuring the conduct, of public characters, it
would be found that the censure so freely bestowed is oftentimes unmerited
and uncharitable.</p>

<p>Where is the man to be found who wishes to remain indebted for
the defense of his own person and property to the exertions, the bravery,
and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to repay
the debt of honor and gratitude?</p>

<p>There is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists
in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between
virtue and happiness, between duty and advantage, between the genuine
maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of
public prosperity and felicity.</p>

<p>Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence the jealousy of a
free people ought to be constantly awake.</p>

<p>The name American must always exalt the just pride of Patriotism.</p>

<p>To the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the
whole is indispensable.</p>

<p>Every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest
should be indignantly frowned upon.</p>

<p>Let us impart all the blessings we possess, or ask for ourselves, to the
whole family of mankind.</p>

<p>Let us erect a standard to which the wise and honest may repair.</p>

<p>'Tis substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring
of popular government.</p>

<p>It is incumbent upon every person of every description to contribute
to his country's welfare.</p>

<p>It would be repugnant to the vital principles of our government virtually
to exclude from public trusts, talents and virtue, unless accompanied
by wealth.</p>

<p>Give such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our
commerce less dependent on foreign bottoms.</p>

<p>I have never made an appointment from a desire to serve a friend or
relative.</p>

<p>Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire,
conscience.</p>

<p class="caption3">WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL TO THE ARMY</p>

<p class="caption3">(<i>Dated at Rocky Hill, near Princeton, New Jersey, November 2, 1783</i>)</p>

<p>It is universally acknowledged that the enlarged prospects of happiness,
opened by the confirmation of our independence and sovereignty, almost
exceed the power of description. And shall not the brave men who have
contributed so essentially to these inestimable acquisitions, retiring victorious
from the field of war to the field of agriculture, participate in all
the blessings which have been obtained? In such a republic, who will
exclude them from the rights of citizens and the fruits of their labor?</p>

<p>To those hardy soldiers who are actuated by the spirit of adventure,
the fisheries will afford ample and profitable employment; and the extensive
and fertile regions of the West will yield a most happy asylum
to those who, fond of domestic enjoyment, are seeking personal independence.</p>

<p>Little is now wanting to enable the soldier to change the military
character into that of a citizen but that steady and decent behavior which
has distinguished not only the army under this immediate command, but
the different detachments and separate armies through the course of the
war. To the various branches of the army the General takes this last
and solemn opportunity of professing his inviolable attachment and friendship.
He can only again offer in their behalf his recommendations to their
grateful country and his prayers to the God of armies. May ample justice
be done them here, and may favors, both here and hereafter, attend those
who, under the divine auspices, have secured innumerable blessings for
others!</p>

<p>With these wishes and this benediction the commander-in-chief is about
to retire from service. The curtain of separation will soon be drawn, and
the military scene to him will be closed forever!</p>


<p class="caption3">WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS</p>

<p class="caption3">(<i>To the People of the United States&mdash;September 17, 1796</i>)</p>

<p>Friends and Fellow-Citizens:</p>

<p>The period for a new election of a citizen to administer the executive
Government of the United States being not far distant, and the time
actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating
the person who is to be clothed with that important trust it appears to
me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression
of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of the resolution I
have formed, to decline being considered among the number of those
out of whom a choice is to be made....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate
the career of my public life my feelings do not permit me to suspend
the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my
beloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still
more for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me, and
for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable
attachment, by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness
unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these
services, let it always be remembered to your praise, and as an instructive
example in our annals, that under circumstances in which
the passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead, amidst
appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging,
in situations in which not unfrequently want of success has countenanced
the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support was the
essential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans by which
they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry
it with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that
Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence;
that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free
Constitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained;
that its administration in every department may be stamped
with wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of
these States, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete, by
so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing, as will
acquire for them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the
affection and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.</p>

<p>Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare,
which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger,
natural to that solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present, to
offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent
review, some sentiments, which are the result of much reflection, of
no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important
to the permanency of your felicity as a People.</p>

<p>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts,
no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment.</p>

<p>The unity of government, which constitutes you one people, is also
now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of
your real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your
peace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty
which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that from different
causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken,
many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this
truth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which the
batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and
actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of infinite
moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of
your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; that
you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it,
accustoming yourself to think and speak of it as of the palladium of
your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion
that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and indignantly frowning
upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of
our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link
together the various parts.</p>

<p>For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens,
by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right
to concentrate your affections. The name 'American,' which belongs to
you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism
more than any appellation derived from local discriminations. With
slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits,
and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and triumphed
together; the independence and liberty you possess are the work
of joint counsels, and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings, and
successes.</p>

<p>But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves
to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more
immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds
the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the
union of the whole....</p>

<p>To the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole
is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts can
be an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience the infractions
and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced.
Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your first
essay by the adoption of a constitution of government better calculated
than your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious management
of your common concerns. This government, the offspring of our
own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation
and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the distribution
of its powers uniting security with energy and containing within
itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence
and your support. Respect for its authority, compliance with its
laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental
maxims of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right of
the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. But
the constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and
authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The
very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government
presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established
government.</p>

<p>All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and
associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design
to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action
of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle
and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give an
artificial and extraordinary force: to put in the place of the delegated
will of the nation, the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising
minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror
of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the
organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels,
and modified by mutual interests....</p>

<p>Towards the preservation of your government, and the permanency of
your present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily discountenance
irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority, but also
that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles,
however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be to effect,
in the forms of the constitution, alterations which will impair the energy
of the system, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown.
In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and
habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of government as
of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard by
which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country;
that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion,
exposes to perpetual change, from the endless variety of hypothesis and
opinion; and remember, especially, that, for the efficient management
of your common interests, in a country so extensive as ours, a government
of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty
is indispensable. Liberty itself will find in such a government, with
powers properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed,
little else than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand
the enterprise of faction, to confine each member of the society
within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure
and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property....</p>

<p>Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity,
religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that
man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these
great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of
men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought
to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections
with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, where
is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious
obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in
courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that
morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded
to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure,
reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality
can prevail in exclusion of religious principle....</p>

<p>Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the
general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a
government gives force to public opinion it is essential that public
opinion should be enlightened.</p>

<p>As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public
credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible,
avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but remembering
also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent
much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the accumulation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous
exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable
wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity
the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these
maxims belongs to your representatives, but it is necessary that the
public opinion should cooperate....</p>

<p>Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace
and harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct; and
can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy
of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great nation, to give to
mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always
guided by an exalted justice and benevolence.</p>


<p class="caption3">TRIBUTES</p>

<p>The life of our Washington cannot suffer by a comparison with those
of other countries who have been most celebrated and exalted by fame.
The attributes and decorations of royalty could have only served to
eclipse the majesty of those virtues which made him, from being a
modest citizen, a more resplendent luminary.</p>

<p>Malice could never blast his honor, and envy made him a single exception
to her universal rule. For himself he had lived enough to life and to
glory. For his fellow-citizens, if their prayers could have been answered,
he would have been immortal. His example is complete, and it will teach
wisdom and virtue to magistrates, citizens, and men, not only in the
present age, but in future generations, as long as our history shall be read.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>John Adams</i><br /></p>

<p>Washington stands alone and unapproachable like a snow peak rising
above its fellows into the clear air of morning, with a dignity, constancy,
and purity which have made him the ideal type of civic virtue to succeeding
generations.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>James Bryce</i><br /></p>

<p>First in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen, he
was second to none in the humble and endearing scenes of private life,
pious, just, humane, temperate, and sincere, uniform, dignified, and commanding,
his example was as edifying to all around him, as were the
effects of that example lasting.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Henry Lee</i><br /></p>

<p>Others of our great men have been appreciated&mdash;many admired by all.
But him we love. Him we all love. About and around him we call up
no dissentient and discordant and dissatisfied elements, no sectional
prejudice nor bias, no party, no creed, no dogma of politics. None of
these shall assail him. When the storm of battle blows darkest and rages
highest, the memory of Washington shall nerve every American arm and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
cheer every American heart. It shall relume that Promethean fire, that
sublime flame of patriotism, that devoted love of country, which his
words have commended, which his example has consecrated.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Rufus Choate</i><br /></p>

<p>Let a man fasten himself to some great idea, some large truth, some
noble cause, even in the affairs of this world, and it will send him forward
with energy, with steadfastness, with confidence. This is what
Emerson meant when he said: "Hitch your wagon to a star." These
are the potent, the commanding, the enduring men&mdash;in our own history,
men like Washington and Lincoln. They may fail, they may be defeated,
they may perish; but onward moves the cause, and their souls go marching
on with it, for they are part of it, they have believed in it.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Henry van Dyke</i><br /></p>

<p>Brave without temerity, laborious without ambition, generous without
prodigality, noble without pride, virtuous without severity&mdash;Washington
seems always to have confined himself within those limits where the
virtues, by clothing themselves in more lively but more changeable and
doubtful colors, may be mistaken for faults. Inspiring respect, he inspires
confidence, and his smile is always the smile of benevolence.</p>

<p class="caption2">ARBOR DAY</p>

<p class="caption3">FOREWORD IN PAMPHLET ON ARBOR DAY ISSUED IN 1913</p>


<p>The following are the provisions of the statutes of the State concerning
the observance of Arbor Day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The day in each year known as Arbor Day shall be suitably observed in
the public schools. The Commissioner of Education shall from time to
time prepare and issue to schools such circulars of information, advice and
instruction with reference to the day as he may deem necessary.</p>

<p>For the purpose of encouraging the planting of shade and forest trees,
the second Friday of April in each year is hereby designated as a day for
the general observance of such purpose, and to be known as Arbor Day.</p>

<p>On said day appropriate exercises shall be introduced in all the schools
of the State, and it shall be the duty of the several county and city superintendents
to prepare a program of exercises for that day in all the schools
under their respective jurisdiction.</p>
</div>

<p>You will notice that Arbor Day now occurs on the second Friday
of April, the Legislature of 1912 having changed the date.</p>

<p>It is believed that Arbor Day may not only be devoted to the consideration
of the value of trees and forests, including, of course, the
planting of trees and shrubs, but that it may also be used to direct
attention to birds and their protection, to the importance of the school
garden, and to other related matters. The conservation of some of
our natural resources might well be considered as the broad theme of
the day, the main emphasis, however, being placed on trees.</p>

<p>Much of the contents of this pamphlet will afford suggestive material
for the use of teachers at any appropriate time. The general
information given may be of help to many teachers throughout the
spring months. The discussions of the various subjects presented
may afford valuable reading material in the grammar schools.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the pamphlet is to give an impetus to the
movement for a greater interest in our natural resources, and the
movement for a greater appreciation of the opportunities offered by
rural or semi-rural life. It is hoped that the suggestions made are
such as may appeal to the interests of children.</p>

<p>It is hoped that Arbor Day may be a profitable one to the pupils in
the schools. It is further hoped that the influence of the contents of
the pamphlet may not be confined to any one day, but may be extended
to many days of the school year.</p>

<p class="caption3">LETTER ISSUED TO SCHOOL OFFICIALS IN 1919</p>

<p>Arbor Day will occur this year on Friday, April 11. An announcement
concerning it may be found in the March number of the Education
Bulletin.</p>

<p>It has been happily suggested by Secretary Houston of the Department
of Agriculture at Washington that the day be observed in part
this year by planting trees upon our roadways, in our yards, and in
our pleasure places, each tree being named for a soldier who has
fallen in the late War. Such trees would be appropriate memorials
to these soldiers.</p>

<p>I suggest that this particular year there be wide-spread planting
of trees dedicated to those whose lives have been sacrificed in the
War. The planting of the trees should be marked with some appropriate
exercises and these exercises should take on more than a school
significance. The whole community should be invited by the school
to take part.</p>

<p>I trust there may be a generous response on the part of the schools
of New Jersey to this idea.</p>

<p class="caption3">TREES AND FORESTS</p>

<p class="caption3">ALFRED GASKILL, STATE FORESTER</p>

<p>Save What We Have, Let Planting Come After</p>

<p>When the farmers of Nebraska, led by J. Sterling Morton, established
Arbor Day in 1872, they sought the threefold blessing that
trees always give&mdash;shade from the summer sun, shelter from winter
winds, and wood. These men found the broad prairies of the Middle
West practically treeless and they soon discovered that unless nature's
fault was remedied the homes they hoped to make could be neither
pleasant, nor secure, nor successful.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, as in all parts of the East, conditions were and
are different. The whole state was originally unbroken forest, and
the task of the pioneers was to make room for fields and settlements.
Nearly half our area (46 per cent) is still forest, though the greater
part has been reduced to a woefully poor condition. Thus if <i>our</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
festival is to serve <i>our</i> needs, we will celebrate Arbor Day in such, a
way that we shall learn to improve the forests we have rather than
seek to make more; to protect and care for the trees we have as well
as to plant more; to get rid of false impressions and broaden our
understanding of the relations between tree life and human society.</p>

<p>New Jersey cannot spare more land for forests. She now has upwards
of two million acres, and if we apply the rule that a state with
30 per cent of her area in forests is well off, we shall reduce the total
to about a million and a half acres. But this will adjust itself; our
present concern is to stop the waste of our forest resources and bring
them to serve one of the most highly organized communities in the
nation.</p>

<p>With respect to trees, as distinguished from forests, this intensive
life and concentrated population make it imperative that cities and
towns be provided with parks and as much street shade as possible.
Thus there are two ample fields for study and work, the one dealing
with trees and their social bearings, the other with forests and their
economic relations.</p>

<p>The art of caring for <i>trees</i> is called arboriculture, and one who devotes
himself to it an arborist. The art of producing and developing
tree communities, or <i>forests</i>, is silviculture or forestry.</p>

<p class="caption3">HOW TREES LIVE AND GROW</p>

<p>The intimate study of trees is full of interest. The sap, consisting
of raw food material gathered by the root hairs from the soil, courses
upward, through the newer wood cells of trunk and branch, to the
leaves; there, under the action of sunlight, it is assimilated with carbon
dioxide, and, so prepared as tree food, passes downward through the
newer bark. Thus, the process never entirely suspended, even in
winter, but varying in vigor with the seasons, the tree grows in stature
by producing new shoots each year. No part of a tree that has concluded
a season's growth is ever elongated, but remains fixed, and
length is added to its terminal by the development of new buds. This
is why a branch always remains at the height at which it started. On
account of this fact the age of a tree or branch may be determined
by counting back from the terminal one year for each section of development.
On most deciduous trees this is hard to follow for more than
a few years, but on the evergreens, which produce their branches in
whorls, it is easy. On the other hand, diameter growth may continue
indefinitely and is exhibited on any cross-section in a series of annual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
rings. A count of these rings will give the age of the tree at that
point.</p>

<p>Other interesting things to know are the means by which trees support
themselves upright, even in severe storms; how they support the
weight of heavy branches; and how the various species differ in the
form, color, texture of their bark. Then the flowers and fruits. Few
people know that the early spring awakening of the silver maple is
marked by the appearance of its flowers weeks before the leaves come
out, or that pines and oaks have flowers at all. And so with the fruits:
willows produce catkins; chestnuts, burs; elms, samaras; spruce,
cones.</p>

<p class="caption3">KNOWING THE TREES</p>

<p>And then one who is fond of trees will not be satisfied until he
can recognize and name at least the commoner kinds. This is field
work for many seasons, for the variations as well as the fixed characters
must be observed, and there are at least a hundred species to be
found in New Jersey. The student will soon want a handbook like
Collins and Preston's "Key to Trees," but without that he will distinguish
the two great groups&mdash;evergreen and deciduous. The evergreens
are also called conifers because the fruit of most of them is a
cone. Almost all are ornamental but none is suitable for the street.
Their wood is commonly called soft, though that of many species is
quite hard, and forms the great bulk of coarse lumber used for building,
etc.</p>

<p>Deciduous trees are so called because their leaves fall at the beginning
of winter. There are many more kinds or species of these than
of evergreens and their forms and characters are more varied. A few
have recognized values as shade trees; many more are interesting or
attractive in the park or on the lawn; others are never found outside
the forest. By way of contrast with that of the conifers, the wood
of deciduous trees is called hard, though many kinds are quite soft,
and the trees themselves hardwoods. Hardwood lumber is often very
beautiful, and is used for many purposes besides furniture, but the
world could better get along without it than without soft woods.</p>

<p class="caption3">SHADE TREES</p>

<p>One is attracted to a noble oak, a graceful hemlock, a beautifully
colored maple, and wants to live with it and its kind. This desire
deserves to be satisfied, and can be satisfied by encouraging the planting
of trees where they will reduce the glare and heat of city streets;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
on lawns and in parks they are more at home and can be treated so
that the beauty of individuals and the values of groups or masses can
be brought out. Especially should they find place upon every school
ground so that the attention of the children may be constantly drawn
to these hungry, thirsty, breakable, burnable, beautiful friends of man.</p>

<p>The kinds of trees that may be planted upon a city street are few,
for the life is so hard that only the hardiest can stand it. If we name
Norway Maple, Ginkgo, Sycamore, White Elm, Red Oak, the list of
the best is exhausted. Others may often be planted where conditions
are favorable, and for lawns and parks the list of availables is almost
endless, but in any case the wisest course is to avoid novelties and
get some one who is experienced to do the planting.</p>

<p>But more important than to plant a tree is to protect and develop
one already in the right place. This applies especially to trees beside
country roads. A newly planted tree has a precarious hold on life
for several years, whereas an old one has survived many dangers. Let,
therefore, the care of the trees that are found in place be the first concern.
Guard them from all that may increase their infirmities, keep
in check the insects that seek to destroy them, have their wounds attended
to and their branches pruned where necessary. This is work
for one who knows how, not for the butcher who "tops" a tree "to make
it grow"; or for the "tree doctor" who uses cement without knowing
whether it will do good or do harm. Reputable men can be found to
do any work of this kind. Under wise direction there should be no
hesitation about cutting down a tree that is in the way. In many
places houses and streets are too much shaded.</p>

<p>The fundamental idea to be grasped is that every tree is an organism;
in one view an individual, in another a community. We must
satisfy at least its strongest requirements or it cannot live. To the
extent that all are satisfied is the tree healthy and vigorous.</p>

<p class="caption3">FORESTS</p>

<p>As with trees so with the tree communities called forests. Our
duty in New Jersey is to improve the forests we have rather than to
concern ourselves about getting more. Of course, waste land may be
redeemed by planting with trees, but where there is a remnant of the
old forest, nature can be trusted to bring another if she is given a
fair chance. The forest secured in this way may not yield so much
lumber as one that was planted, and it will not satisfy a forester, but
it will answer our most immediate needs, and can be secured more
quickly than any other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>And again, as with trees, let no one fear to have a forest cut off when
its time comes. Forest trees were made for use and if they are not
used as they mature, nature will get rid of them by decay. That this
must be so will appear when one observes that in any piece of native
woods room is made for young trees by the fall of old ones that have
lived their term.</p>

<p class="caption3">WHY FORESTS ARE GOOD</p>

<p>Nature clothed most of the habitable earth with forests of one kind
or another and evidently meant that they should serve mankind. This
they do by furnishing wood for shelter and for warmth (seven-eighths
of the people of the world still use wood for fuel), by providing grateful
shade in summer and protection from cold winds in winter, by
preventing the soil on steep hillsides from being lost by erosion, by
regulating the flow of streams. The contention that forests cause
rainfall, or materially influence the climate of a country, is not established.
The weight of evidence indicates that forests thrive in proportion
to the rainfall rather than that the rain falls in proportion
to the extent of forests. And in respect to stream flow we must distinguish
between a mountainous or hilly country and a country that
is flat; and whether the rain commonly falls in brief, heavy storms
or in frequent gentle showers. For instance, we can say with assurance
that in North Jersey a forested watershed will discharge a
purer, more regular stream than one that is unforested, while in
South Jersey the influence of the forest upon the streams is negligible.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE FORESTS OF NEW JERSEY</p>

<p>As the climate of New Jersey is much the same in all parts, the
character of our forests is determined chiefly by soil conditions. Fortunately
we have a great diversity, and between the northern and
southern sections, strong contrasts. The line separating these sections
is nowhere sharply defined but is commonly assumed to run more or
less irregularly from Long Branch to Salem.</p>

<p>The forests of North Jersey, supported by soils of considerable
fertility, are almost universally of the mixed hardwood type common
to the greater part of the central United States east of the Mississippi
River. That is, they are composed of a variety of deciduous trees in
which are many oaks, chestnut, beech, several maples, ashes, hickories,
elms, birches, etc. As exceptions or variants to the type are swampy
areas in which black spruce and hemlock are dominant, and sterile
mountain crests bearing the pitch pine and scrub oak of the poorest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
South Jersey sands. This kind of forest, in which each species occupies
the position to which it is best adapted, and from which therefore
all competitors are excluded, is considered by ecologists the most
highly developed vegetable society.</p>

<p>And about and among these forests is the most fully developed human
society&mdash;villages, towns and cities.</p>

<p>Practically all these forests have been several times cut over and
many times burned. Individual trees about settlements are often
noble and imposing, and occasional groves of fine trees are found, but
the forest is only a reminder of what it was&mdash;and a promise of what
it may be.</p>

<p>In South Jersey the contrast with North Jersey is emphasized in
every way. Instead of hills and valleys the land is level or gently
rolling. Near the Delaware and at numerous points in the interior
are fertile soils and thriving communities, but much of the territory
is characterized by sand and forests of pine, with an undergrowth of
scrub oak, often covering hundreds of thousands of acres. This condition
justifies the common name of the region "The Pines," though
variations in soil frequently give rise to considerable areas of tree
oaks, and swamps of white cedar border many of the streams.</p>

<p>On the sandy land profitable agriculture is full of uncertainties; but
forestry is not, for there the pitch pine, though burned almost to extinction
by the fires that for years swept annually across the level
reaches, persists and wherever given a few years' immunity from fire,
sends up its arms of living green. Here is the great forest area of
the state; one of those tracts fitted by nature to maintain trees of
a single kind, or single class. These "pure" forests, so called in contrast
to the mixed forests of richer regions, are found in the southern
states, in the far North and in the Rocky Mountains. They are
easily developed, easily logged, and always will be, as they now are, the
chief source of the world's lumber supply.</p>

<p class="caption3">FIRE</p>

<p>The key to the forest problem in New Jersey, as in every state, is
the control of fire. A few years ago it was an undenied fact that
more forest was destroyed by fire every year than by the ax. Burning
the forest to make plow-land was justifiable when trees were an encumbrance,
but the practice got us into bad habits. From being a
servant, fire became a master. Without fires, we in New Jersey can
and will have all the forest we need; with fires, that which is bad
becomes worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The lesson for Arbor Day, and for every day, therefore, is to urge
and require that no forest shall be burned. It is good fun to sit
about a camp-fire, yet the danger that the fire will escape and do harm
is great. Even a surface-fire that apparently burns only dry leaves,
and is often set for that purpose, will kill the young trees that are
just starting on the struggle for life. Fortunately New Jersey is getting
her fires under control. Firewardens are located wherever there
are forests; their duty is to prevent fires by every means possible, and
if a fire is started they must summon men to put it out. The forests
are already responding to this protection and proving their ability to
take care of themselves when relieved of the frightful handicap that
has been upon them for generations.</p>

<p class="caption3">PRACTICAL FORESTRY</p>

<p>Though fire control will make a forest where conditions are favorable
as here, the skill of a forester is needed to make it a good and a
productive forest. Here is applied a knowledge that is more intimate
than that which serves to recognize a tree or to provide for its physical
well-being. The successful forester must be a practical scientist in
many departments; must have executive ability and be a capable business
man. All who cannot meet these requirements should be discouraged
from seeking to make forestry their profession.</p>

<p class="caption3">PARKS</p>

<p>Every urban community needs parks where those who live in close
quarters can find fresh air. And a state with many cities must make
it possible for the people to get into the open&mdash;not for an hour only,
but for days and weeks. New Jersey can do this in the woodlands
that are so near to most of the large cities. It is not always necessary
that the state take title to the land; few owners object to reasonable
use and almost all would gladly remove every restriction if they were
assured that the privilege would not be abused.</p>

<p>The timber forests of continental Europe are universally used as
great public parks. Good roads make all parts accessible and the
tourists are so accustomed to behave themselves that no serious harm
is done. We can have ample parks of this kind at no more cost than
assuring the owners' material interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption3">STATE AID</p>

<p>The state of New Jersey is prepared to help its citizens in any interest
connected with the soil. The State Forester, Trenton, will advise
individuals or communities regarding the care of shade trees and
the planting or management of forests. The Agricultural Experiment
Station, New Brunswick, and the Department of Agriculture, Trenton,
will afford similar assistance upon any subject connected with farms,
orchards or gardens. Anyone who wants to know about any of these
subjects has the right to ask questions and to seek advice.</p>


<p class="caption3">ARBOR DAY MAY BE OBSERVED BY PLANTING A
HAMILTON GROVE</p>

<p class="caption3">CHARLES A. PHILHOWER, SUPERVISING PRINCIPAL, WESTFIELD</p>

<p>The following fitting observance of Arbor Day, commemorating an
historic incident in the life of Alexander Hamilton, was conducted in
Mindowaskin Park, Westfield, April 12, 1918. The program took its
origin from the following narrative:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Alexander Hamilton, in the year 1801, planted a grove of thirteen trees
at his home, "Hamilton Grange," 143d Street, west of Convent Avenue,
New York City. The trees were the liquidambar styraciflua, sweet or red
gum, and were sent from the South. Each one of the thirteen trees was
named for one of the thirteen original colonies. The group of trees was
later known as the "Hamilton Grove." Martha Washington became
greatly interested both in its upkeep and in its preservation.</p>
</div>

<p>The program was as follows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The schools marched to the park with flags and assembled en masse.</p>

<p>As the flag was raised, the Star Spangled Banner was sung, a cornetist
leading.</p>

<p>Address by Honorable Arthur N. Pierson.</p>

<p>Song, "Over There."</p>

<p>Planting of trees: Each of the thirteen grades, from the kindergarten
through the twelfth grade, planted a tree. As the trees for
the states were planted the following passages were read. When the
New Jersey tree was planted the whole audience joined in the response.</p>

<p>A record of the plantings was filed in the school. On each succeeding

used in some localities with greater certainty of thriving.</p>
</div>

<p class="caption3">SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</p>

<p class="caption3">K. C. DAVIS, FORMERLY OF STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, NEW
BRUNSWICK</p>

<p>As the season of planting is upon us and all nature is preparing
to show her most gorgeous dress, we should interest the pupil in ways
of beautifying the school. There is not a school in the land that cannot
be made better, and many of them may be improved very much.
The pupils will take a great interest in the matter if they receive a
little encouragement and leadership on the part of their teachers.</p>

<p>Beautify the school grounds. A woven wire trellis supporting a
thrifty vine would be a splendid screen for unsightly outbuildings.
Shrubs about the foundations of the school building, in the angles
of walks, and in natural clumps in the corners of the grounds would
add beauty to the school surroundings. A few plots not used for play
nor for garden may be grassed. Never scatter the trees or shrubs
openly about the lawn area. Better mass the shrubs in natural clumps
in angles or foundations, walks and borders. Use the trees along
boundary and division lines. Native trees and shrubs are always preferable
to imported or exotic kinds.</p>

<p class="caption3">PLANNING FOR ARBOR DAY</p>

<p>Arbor Day plans should be begun early and should include a number
of lines of preparatory work.</p>

<p>Send for the bulletins first.</p>

<p>Draw plans of the grounds, measuring the lines and distances to
make it somewhat accurate. If a class is assigned to this task the best
map may be framed for the future use of the school. A passepartout
binding, at least, may be used. This map may show the plan of planting
for several years if there is more to be planted than can be done
this year. The walks, buildings, clumps of shrubs, trees, school garden,
playgrounds, etc., should all be shown.</p>

<p>This work may be done by arithmetic or geography classes. The
arithmetic class may also find suitable dimensions for the corn-contest
plots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Have the reading classes read about birds, gardening, trees, lawns,
weeds, etc. Use the newer words in spelling exercises. Let boys and
girls both make bird-houses at home. These may be ready to put up
on Arbor Day.</p>

<p>The corn testing and seed study should begin at once.</p>

<p>Trees, shrubs and seeds that are to be planted on Arbor Day, or
soon after, should be ready in advance. The roots of trees and shrubs
must be temporarily covered with soil to prevent drying out.</p>

<p>Some exercises in root grafting of apples may be carried out as
described in two of the bulletins, 113 and 408.</p>

<p>Tools to be used in the planting of school grounds may be brought
by pupils from their homes; the list available for the purpose should
be made in advance.</p>

<p>Divide the students into suitable groups for the work, so that each
will know his part.</p>

<p>Invite parents and home folks to the work of Arbor Day, and make
it a community exercise. The men may come in the morning to work,
and the women may come with lunch baskets at noon, both staying
until the exercises are over.</p>

<p>Plan to have some one take pictures of the children and patrons
while the improvement work is going on.</p>

<p>Do not forget to have some manure and good soil hauled in advance.</p>


<p class="caption3">SUGGESTIVE PROGRAMS</p>

<p class="caption3">THE VALUE OF OUR FORESTS</p>

<p>Few people ever think of a forest as a place to store water. Who would
think that "the woods" hold water as well as a mill pond or a reservoir!
But they do, although we cannot see the water they hold, except, perhaps,
as a pool here and there; and yet this is one of the most important functions
that a forest can perform.</p>

<p>All of us have noticed in walking through the woods how soft and
springy the ground is. A thick carpet of leaves, twigs, and decayed wood
covers the earth, sometimes to a depth of several feet. It is very porous,
and it absorbs water like a sponge. When storms come and rain falls in
torrents, it does not beat directly upon the ground under the trees because
the raindrops first strike the leaves and branches above. The water then
trickles gently down and soaks into the leafy carpet. If the forest is extensive
a very large quantity of water is absorbed&mdash;enough to prevent
floods except in extraordinarily long periods of rain. Gradually through
the weeks and months that follow the absorbed water oozes out of low
places as "springs," and it dashes merrily away in little brooks that continue
to form creeks and rivers which flow peacefully and steadily out to
sea.</p>

<p>If there are no trees, no leaves to break the beating rain, no spongy
mold to hold the water when it falls, no matted roots to prevent washing,
the big raindrops spatter upon the earth and quickly form rushing streams
that wash the ground into gulleys. The bare earth absorbs some water, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
be sure, but far less than the humus of the forest. If the rains are continued
the rivers are soon filled beyond the capacity of their banks and
they spread over the neighboring valleys, carrying devastation with them.
After the heavy rains cease, the flood waters subside as suddenly as they
had arisen and the streams dwindle to insignificance, sometimes completely
drying up in a long, hot summer.</p>

<p>Thus it is that forests act as great reservoirs and aid in preventing disastrous
floods and in maintaining the flow of streams at a rate that is
nearly uniform all the year round.</p>

<p>Now let us see what use is made of the trees. The greatest of all is for
firewood; but this is largely the decaying or faulty trees from the
farmer's woodlot, the waste product of a lumber region, or from land that
is cleared for cultivation. It is said that about 100,000,000 cords are used
annually.</p>

<p>The greater part of the salable timber, however, is sawed into lumber,
which is used in a variety of ways. The first and greatest use of lumber
is for building houses, barns, sheds, outbuildings and fences.</p>

<p>Next comes furniture of all kinds&mdash;chairs, tables, beds, and all other
house, office, and school furniture; musical instruments; vehicles of all
kinds&mdash;wagons, carriages, buggies, and parts of automobiles; agricultural
implements&mdash;plows, harrows, harvesters, thrashing machines, and other
farm implements.</p>

<p>Car building is another great use for lumber&mdash;freight cars, passenger
cars, and trolley cars. Other important uses for timber are as cross-ties,
poles for telegraph and telephone lines, and "shoring" or supports in
mines. Even more trees are used in the manufacture of paper than for
these purposes. Then there are various small articles used in the home,
such as spools, butter dishes, fruit crates, baskets, boxes, all kinds of tools,
toys, picture frames, matches, pencils, clothes pins, toothpicks, etc. These
are little things, but so many of them are used that they consume a great
deal of wood. Next we derive tannic acid for tanning leather, turpentine
and rosin, maple sugar, and many extracts used in making medicines.</p>

<p>So valuable are the forests that the whole nation is interested in preserving
them. No one is benefited more by them than the farmer, and no
one should be more interested in them.&mdash;<i>U. S. Bureau of Education Bulletin,

<p>Preparatory to the making and carrying out of a Memorial Day
program, the teacher, a group of pupils or some wide-awake member
of the community should talk about the sacrifices made by the soldiers
of our country during the different wars in which we have been engaged;
what great principles they have fought for, and why we
should honor their memory in the public schools of our land.
Throughout the preparation and the execution of the program there
should be a consciousness of the debt we owe to those who have fought
and died for freedom's cause. The simplest program prepared in
this spirit will be of lasting value to the children of the school and
to the members of the community in which the exercises are held.</p>

<p>Pupils and teachers should talk over fully the kind of program to
be given. Much responsibility should be placed upon the pupils for
the making of the program. They should make all "projects" necessary
for the carrying out of the program, and should invite all patrons
and friends in the community.</p>

<p>The exercises should be a service truly commemorating the honored

<p>The observance of May 30 as Memorial Day had its official origin
in an order issued in 1868 by General John A. Logan, then commander-in-chief
of the Grand Army of the Republic. General Logan often
said afterward that the issuing of that order was the proudest act
of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The strewing of flowers upon graves is old in some countries. It
is said that the first decoration of graves of soldiers of the Civil War
was done on April 13, 1862, by two little girls, daughters of a Michigan
chaplain. They had been out gathering wild flowers, and, returning,
came across a rough, unmarked mound which covered some
northern boy.</p>

<p>One of the girls said: "Oh, let's put our flowers on this grave!
He was a soldier boy." They knelt down and made garlands of
flowers on that grave. This grave was in Virginia, not far from
Mount Vernon. The next day they interested their family and
friends in a plan to decorate all the graves, and the plan was carried
out. Each year afterward, in May, they did the same wherever they
happened to be. Others saw them and followed their example.</p>

<p>The later date of May 30 was chosen by General Logan so that
flowers could be had in all the northern states.</p>

<p>From decorating the graves of soldiers the custom has extended to
the graves of all who have relatives or friends to remember them.
In time the soldiers will be forgotten, but the custom of decorating
graves with flowers will doubtless continue for many generations to
come. The spirit which prompts it is a noble one, which should ever
be cherished.</p>

<p>Two years after the close of the Civil War the <i>New York Tribune</i>
printed a paragraph simply stating that "the women of Columbus,
Mississippi, have shown themselves impartial in their offerings made
to the memory of the dead. They strewed flowers alike on the graves
of the Confederate and of the National soldiers."</p>

<p>Whereupon the North thrilled with tenderness and Francis Miles
Finch was inspired to write his moving lyric "The Blue and the
Gray," which has become the credo of the Festival.</p>

<p>In a famous address, Chauncey M. Depew related the occurrence
with felicity: "When the war was over in the South, where under
warmer skies and with more poetic temperaments symbols and emblems
are better understood than in the practical North, the widows,
mothers, and the children of the Confederate dead went out and
strewed their graves with flowers; at many places the women scattered
them impartially also over the unknown and unmarked resting-places
of the Union soldiers. As the news of this touching tribute
flashed over the North it roused, as nothing else could have done,
national amity and love and allayed sectional animosity and passion.
Thus out of sorrows common alike to North and South comes this
beautiful custom."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The incident, however, produced no practical results until in May,
1868, Adjutant-General N. P. Chipman suggested to National Commander
John A. Logan, of the Grand Army of the Republic, that
their organization inaugurate the custom of spreading flowers on the
graves of the Union soldiers at some uniform time. General Logan
immediately issued an order naming the 30th day of May, 1868, "for
the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the
graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the
late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village,
or hamlet churchyard in the land.... It is the purpose of the
commander-in-chief to inaugurate this observance with the hope that
it will be kept up from year to year while a survivor of the war remains
to honor the memory of the departed."</p>

<p>The idea spread rapidly. Legislature after legislature enacted it
into law until the holiday has become a legal one in all states. In
some of the southern states an earlier date is usually chosen.</p>

<p>We have scattered our floral tributes today over the graves of the
patriotic dead. These frail mementos of affection will soon wither, but
let not the memory of these martyrs fail to inspire in us a purer, holier
life! The roll-call brings to mind their faces and their deeds. They were
faithful to the end. The weary march, the bivouac, the battle are still
remembered by the survivors. But your line, comrades, is growing
slenderer every year. One by one you will drop out of the ranks, and
other hands may ere long strew your grave with flowers as you have done
today in yonder cemetery. When mustered in the last grand review, with
all the veterans and heroes of earth, may each receive with jubilant heart
the Great Commander's admiring tribute "Well done!" and become with
Him partaker of a felicity that is enduring and triumphant!</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>E. P. Thwing</i><br /></p>


<p>Of all the martial virtues, the one which is perhaps most characteristic
of the truly brave is the virtue of magnanimity. That sentiment, immortalized
by Scott in his musical and martial verse, will associate for
all time the name of Scotland's king with those of the great spirits of
the past. How grand the exhibitions of the same generous impulses that
characterize this memorable battle-field! My fellow-countrymen of the
North, if I may be permitted to speak for those whom I represent, let
me assure you that in the profoundest depths of their nature, they reciprocate
that generosity with all the manliness and sincerity of which they
are capable. In token of that sincerity they join in consecrating, for annual
patriotic pilgrimage, these historic heights, which drank such copious
draughts of American blood, poured so freely in discharge of duty, as
each conceived it&mdash;a Mecca for the North, which so grandly defended, a
Mecca for the South, which so bravely and persistently stormed it. We
join you in setting apart this land as an enduring monument of peace,
brotherhood, and perpetual union. I repeat the thought with emphasis,
with singleness of heart and of purpose, in the name of a common country,
and of universal liberty; and by the blood of our fallen brothers, we
unite in the solemn consecration of these hallowed hills, as a holy,
eternal pledge of fidelity to the life, freedom, and unity of this cherished
Republic.</p>

<p>Our fathers ordained that in this Republic there should be no distinctions;
but human nature is stronger than laws and nothing can prevent
this people from showing honor to all who have deserved well of the
country. Every man who has borne arms with credit has earned and is

privilege to remember that our armies and navies, regular and volunteer,
have always been worthy of esteem ... the Grand Army of the
Republic&mdash;soldiers and citizens whom the Republic delights to honor.</p>

<p class="caption3">AFTER THE GREAT COMPANIONS!</p>

<p>The race has not run out.</p>

<p>We are still men, and worthy of our fathers.</p>

<p>That is what Memorial Day 1919 says to us.</p>

<p>Not in pride nor vain boasting but in fearful and solemn humility we
speak, for it is our dead that prompt us. They, our kin and blood, were
not afraid to die.</p>

<p>When the Destroyer came, the obscene Dragon, with breath of poison
gas, eyes of hell fire, and teeth of steel, they did not shrink, our brothers,
but played the man, and struck, and dying struck again, and flung their
shredded bodies into the breach, and "filled the gap up with our English
dead."</p>

<p>We are of such.</p>

<p>We put our arms around our dead, and hold them proudly up to God,
and glory before all men that this is our breed.</p>

<p>The lies of the Accuser are disproved. His slanders fall from us. We
are not slaves of greed, money grubbers, soft and lily-livered. We know
how to suffer and to die. We, too, can follow the gleam.</p>

<p>O Greeks of Marathon, room for us! Through Chateau Thierry and
the wood of Argonne we have come up to stand by your side, and dare
to call you Brothers.</p>

<p>You Five Hundred of Balaklava, meet these boys from Kansas and
New York, who also rode blithely into the valley of death. They are
your kind.</p>

<p>You men of Bunker Hill, of Gettysburg and of San Juan, place! place
for these, our neighbors' sons, our friends and playmates!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>For them also the laurel, and the royal requiem! For them the Cross
of Honor, and the Divine Halo!</p>

<p>They are ours! Ours! Dear God, we will be worthy of them. Thus
cries the poet of America:</p>

<p>"Allons! After the great Companions, and to belong to them!</p>

<p>"Allons! through struggles and wars!</p>

<p>"Have the past struggles succeeded?</p>

<p>"What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? Nature?</p>

<p>"Now understand me well&mdash;it is provided in the essence of things that
from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth something
to make a greater struggle necessary.</p>

<p>"Allons! the road is before us!"</p>

<p class="caption3">THE SERVICE FLAG</p>

<p>The service flag is not an official flag of the United States Government.
The idea was, so far as we are advised, an entirely novel one, the credit
for the conception of which appears to be due to R. L. Queisser, of
Cleveland, Ohio, who designed and patented the present flag. It has,
however, taken such firm root in popular sentiment and has been of such
beneficial influence that it is officially recognized, and everyone who is
entitled to fly it is encouraged and urged to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Queisser was formerly captain of the machine gun company, 5th
Ohio Infantry (now 145th United States Infantry), from which he was
retired because of an accident. He thus states the origin of the flag:</p>

<p>"Shortly after April 6, 1917, when war with Germany was declared, the
thought came to me that both of my sons, who were still officers in the
guard, would again be called out, and I wondered if I could not evolve
some sign or symbol by which it might be known that they were away
in their country's service, and one which would be to their mother a
visible sign of the sacrifice her sons were making. The inspiration of
the service flag came to me in that manner."</p>

<p class="caption3">AMERICAN SENTIMENTS</p>

<p>It is a fearful thing to lead this great, peaceful people into war, into
the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to
be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we
shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts&mdash;for
democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have
a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small
nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free
peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world
itself at last free.</p>

<p>To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything
that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who
know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her
blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness
and the peace which she has treasured. God helping her, she can do
no other.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Woodrow Wilson</i><br /></p>


<p>We came into this war for ourselves. It is a war to save America, to
preserve self-respect, to justify our right to live as we have lived, not
as some one else wishes us to live. It is more precious that this America
shall live than that we Americans should live.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Franklin K. Lane</i><br /></p>


<p>No nation has a right to its freedom if it is unwilling to fight for the
freedom of others, and for its own.</p>

<p>The cost of war is not to be measured in money. It is in the slow paid
price of the human heart&mdash;in the blood drops, one by one.</p>

<p class="caption2">FLAG DAY</p>

<p class="caption3">HANNAH H. CHEW, PRINCIPAL CULVER SCHOOL, MILLVILLE</p>


<p>The great war has brought more forcibly to us a realization of the
necessity for training the youth of our land to a greater respect for,
and a fuller knowledge of our national emblem.</p>

<p>Wherever the flag floats, children must be taught to love it and
to respect its significance.</p>

<p>New Jersey long ago required that the flag be displayed on school
buildings, and the flag salute be given daily, but no statute can make
certain that the spirit of the law is emphasized.</p>

<p>The teachers of the children of the state bear the responsibility of
training for patriotism, and the future of democracy depends upon
the patriotic ideals nurtured in the public schools. We shall have
more patriotic observances than formerly and one of those which we
shall celebrate with more interest will be Flag Day.</p>

<p>The date authorized to be observed as Flag Day comes so near the
close of the school year that it may well be used as a special occasion
on which pupil and parent join in paying tribute to our national
emblem.</p>

<p>Flag Day can be made the occasion of raising a new flag, or of
taking a collection to provide silk flags or a patriotic picture for the
classrooms, thus giving parents an opportunity to contribute to the
patriotism of the school. If a new flag is to be presented to the
school, Flag Day will be a most appropriate time to receive it, and
exercises can be conducted partly or altogether out-of-doors. On the
playground all pupils can take part in marches and drills suitable to
their grades. In order to have the best effects, some uniformity of
costume is best. Any movements uniformly done in mass are pleasing,
and teachers can adapt marching figures to their own playground
with good effect. The purpose of the teacher of the primary grades
should be to awaken love and reverence for the flag and to instill
loyalty into the minds and hearts of the children.</p>

<p>In the higher grades children should not only be trained to show
love and respect for the flag, but should understand their duty toward
their country. They should study the flag, its history, its significance,
its various forms and uses, the correct ways of displaying it,
and the proper manner of raising and lowering it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The flag of our state should also be taught, together with its history.</p>

<p>It is a part of our school law that the flag salute shall be a part of
the daily program. It is the duty of the teacher to interpret the
meaning and the spirit of the salute to the pupils, not neglecting the
correct pronunciation of the words. The salute should never be carelessly
repeated, but should be given in a serious manner, and only
after children have been called to standing position.</p>

<p>In the making of a program, attention should be given to current
events. The best of the popular songs may be sung. (Be sure they
are the best.) Current literature will furnish some prose and poetry
suitable for the occasion. A real, present-day note should always be
sounded. The same program should not be used year after year, but
the material should be selected anew each time, though some repetition
in the use of standard recitations and national songs is to be expected.</p>

<p>A scrap-book kept for suitable material will be a valuable aid to
the teacher. Such a scrap-book can be made by using large envelops,
fastening them at the bottom within a cardboard cover, and labelling
each envelop according to its contents. As additions are made to the
songs, poems, programs, etc., a catalog of the contents can be kept on
the outside of the envelop. It will be best to mount recitations on
heavy paper in order to preserve them longer.</p>

<p class="caption3">BRIEF HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN FLAG</p>

<p>On the 2d of July, 1776, the American Congress resolved "that these
united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states;
and that all political connection between us and the states of Great
Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved." On the 4th of July a Declaration
of Independence was adopted by the Congress, and sent out under
its authority, to announce to all other nations that the United States of
America claimed a place among them. On this 4th of July the nation was
born. Its flag, the visible symbol of its power, was not adopted till 1777.</p>

<p>On the 14th of June, 1777, Congress resolved "that the flag of the thirteen
United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the
union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation."</p>

<p>The national flag&mdash;<i>our</i> national flag&mdash;grew in the most direct way out
of the banners that had waved over the colonists. The flag of the United
Colonies had thirteen stripes, one for each colony, and the stripes were
alternate red and white. This part of the old flag remained unchanged in
the new one. Each colony retained its stripe.</p>

<p>The flag of the colonies, in its union, had displayed the king's colors.
There was now no longer a king in America, but a new Union had arisen&mdash;a
Union of Thirteen States&mdash;no longer a Union of kingdoms. The
union of the old flag had been the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew
conjoined on a blue field. The new union was a circle of silver stars in a
blue sky&mdash;"a new constellation."</p>

<p>The flag of the United States was derived from the flag of the United
Colonies in the simplest and most natural manner. The old flag had expressed
the hopes and aspirations of thirteen colonies which had united
in order to secure justice from their king and fellow-countrymen in England.
The new flag expressed the determined resolve of the same thirteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
colonies&mdash;now become sovereign states&mdash;to form a permanent Union, and
to take their place among the nations of the world. They were no longer
Englishmen; they were Americans.</p>

<p>Many suggestions have been made to account for the appearance of
stars or of stripes in the new flag. It seems unnecessary to seek for any
explanation other than the one that has just been given. The old flag of
the United Colonies expressed the feelings and aspirations of the revolted
English colonists. They were willing to remain as subjects of the English
king, but they had united to secure justice. The new flag expressed their
firm resolve to throw off the yoke of England and to become a new nation.
The symbols of each flag exactly expressed the feeling of the men who
bore it.</p>

<p>There is a resemblance between the colors and symbols of the new flag
and the symbols borne on the coat of arms of General Washington that is
worthy of remark. General Washington was a descendant of an English
family, and his ancestors bore a coat of arms that he himself used as a
seal, and for a book-plate.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that the stars of the American flag were suggested
by the three stars of this coat of arms, and this is not impossible. General
Washington was in Philadelphia in June, 1777, and he is said to have
engaged Mrs. John Ross, at that time, to make the first flag, though this
is not absolutely certain.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is known that the American flag of thirteen
stars and of thirteen stripes was displayed at the siege of Fort Stanwix
in August, 1777; at the battle of Brandywine on September 11; at Germantown
on the 4th of October; at the surrender of the British under
General Burgoyne on October 17. The flag had been adopted in June of
the same year. The vessels of the American navy flew this flag on the
high seas, and their victories made it respected everywhere....</p>

<p>The treaty of peace between England and the United States was signed
(at Paris, France) on September 3, 1783. This was the acknowledgment
of Great Britain of the independence of her former colonies; and the
other nations of Europe stood by consenting. Our flag was admitted, at
that time, on equal terms with the standards of ancient kingdoms and
states, to the company of the banners of the world....</p>

<p>In April, 1818, the Congress passed "An Act to Establish the Flag of the
United States":</p>

<p>"Section I. <i>Be it enacted, etc.</i>, That from and after the fourth day of
July next, the flag of the United States be thirteen horizontal stripes, alternate
red and white; that the Union have twenty stars, white in a blue
field.</p>

<p>"Section II. <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That on the admission of every
new state into the union, one star be added to the union of the flag; and
that such addition shall take effect on the fourth of July next succeeding
such admission. <i>Approved</i>, April 4, 1818."</p>

<p>No changes (other than the addition of new stars) have been made in
the national flag since 1818. The stars have been added, one by one, until
in 1898 there are forty-five in all. Every state has its star; each of the
original thirteen states has its stripe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>So long as the United States exists the flag will remain in its present
form, except that new stars will be displayed as the new states come in.
It will forever exhibit the origin of the nation from the thirteen colonies,
and its growth into a Union of sovereign states.</p>

<p class="caption3">MAKERS OF THE FLAG</p>

<p>This morning, as I passed into the Land Office, The Flag dropped me
a most cordial salutation, and from its rippling folds I heard it say:
"Good-morning, Mr. Flag-Maker."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Old Glory," I said, "aren't you mistaken? I am not
the President of the United States, nor a member of Congress, nor even
a general in the army. I am only a Government clerk."</p>

<p>"I greet you again, Mr. Flag-Maker," replied the gay voice. "I know
you well. You are the man who worked in the swelter of yesterday
straightening out the tangle of that farmer's homestead in Idaho, or perhaps
you found the mistake in that Indian contract in Oklahoma, or
helped to clear that patent for the hopeful inventor in New York, or
pushed the opening of that new ditch in Colorado, or made that mine in
Illinois more safe, or brought relief to the old soldier in Wyoming. No
matter; whichever one of these beneficent individuals you may happen
to be, I give you greeting, Mr. Flag-Maker."</p>

<p>I was about to pass on, when the Flag stopped me with these words:</p>

<p>"Yesterday the President spoke a word that made happier the future
of ten million peons in Mexico; but that act looms no larger on the flag
than the struggle which the boy in Georgia is making to win the Corn
Club prize this summer.</p>

<p>"Yesterday the Congress spoke a word which will open the door of
Alaska; but a mother in Michigan worked from sunrise until far into the
night, to give her boy an education. She, too, is making the flag.</p>

<p>"Yesterday we made a new law to prevent financial panics, and yesterday,
maybe, a school teacher in Ohio taught his first letters to a boy
who will one day write a song that will give cheer to the millions of our
race. We are all making the flag."</p>

<p>"But," I said impatiently, "these people were only working!"</p>

<p>Then came a great shout from The Flag:</p>

<p>"The work that we do is the making of the flag.</p>

<p>"I am not the flag; not at all. I am but its shadow.</p>

<p>"I am whatever you make me, nothing more.</p>

<p>"I am your belief in yourself, your dream of what a people may become.</p>

<p>"I live a changing life, a life of moods and passions, of heartbreaks and
tired muscles.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I am strong with pride, when men do an honest work,
fitting the rails together truly.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I droop, for then purpose has gone from me, and cynically
I play the coward.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I am loud, garish, and full of that ego that blasts judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"But always I am all that you hope to be, and have the courage to try
for.</p>

<p>"I am song and fear, struggle and panic, and ennobling hope.</p>

<p>"I am the day's work of the weakest man, and the largest dream of
the most daring.</p>

<p>"I am the Constitution and the courts, statutes and the statute
makers, soldier and dreadnaught, drayman and street sweep, cook,
counselor, and clerk.</p>

<p>"I am the battle of yesterday, and the mistake of tomorrow.</p>

<p>"I am the mystery of the men who do without knowing why.</p>

<p>"I am the clutch of an idea, and the reasoned purpose of resolution.</p>

<p>"I am no more than what you believe me to be and I am all that you
believe I can be.</p>

<p>"I am what you make me, nothing more.</p>

<p>"I swing before your eyes as a bright gleam of color, a symbol of yourself,
the pictured suggestion of that big thing which makes this nation.
My stars and my stripes are your dream and your labors. They are
bright with cheer, brilliant with courage, firm with faith, because you
have made them so out of your hearts. For you are the makers of the
flag and it is well that you glory in the making."</p>

<p>This flag, which we honor and under which we serve, is the emblem of
our unity, our power, our thought and purpose as a nation. It has no
other character than that which we give it from generation to generation.
The choices are ours. It floats in majestic silence above the hosts that
execute those choices, whether in peace or in war. And yet, though silent,
it speaks to us&mdash;speaks to us of the past, of the men and women who
went before us, and of the records they wrote upon it.</p>

<p>We celebrate the day of its birth; and from its birth until now it has
witnessed a great history, has floated on high the symbol of great events,
of a great plan of life worked out by a great people. We are about to
carry it into battle, to lift it where it will draw the fire of our enemies.
We are about to bid thousands, hundreds of thousands, it may be millions,
of our men&mdash;the young, the strong, the capable men of the nation&mdash;to go
forth and die beneath it on fields of blood far away....</p>

<p>Woe be to the man, or group of men, that seeks to stand in our way in
this day of high resolution, when every principle we hold dearest is to be
vindicated and made secure for the salvation of the nations. We are
ready to plead at the bar of history, and our flag shall wear a new luster.
Once more we shall make good with our lives and fortunes the great faith
to which we were born, and a new glory shall shine in the face of our
people.</p>

<p class="caption3">STORY OF THE "STAR SPANGLED BANNER"</p>

<p>In the War of 1812, when an attack was being made upon Fort McHenry,
Mr. Key and his friend were on board an American vessel just in sight
of the enemy's fleet and the flag of Fort McHenry. They remained on
board all through the night, holding their breath at every shell that went
careering over among their countrymen in the fort, and every moment expecting
an explosion.</p>

<p>Suddenly the firing ceased, and as they had no connection with the
enemy's ships they could not find out whether the fort had been abandoned,
or the siege given up. For the remainder of the night they paced
to and fro upon the deck in terrible anxiety, longing for the return of the
day, and looking every few moments at their watches to see how long they
must wait for it.</p>

<p>Light came at last, and they could see that our flag was still there.
At length they were told that the attack had failed and that the British
were re-embarking.</p>

<p>The words of the "Star Spangled Banner" were written by Mr. Key, as
he walked the deck in the darkness and suspense.</p>

<p>In less than an hour after it went into the printer's hands it was all
over town, was hailed with joy, and at once took its place among our national
pieces.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Durag, an actor, saw it, and catching up a volume of flute
music, he whistled tune after tune; at length, he chanced upon one called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
"Anacreon in Heaven," and as note after note fell from his lips, he cried,
"Boys, I've hit it!" Then, taking up the words, there rang out for the
first time the "Song of the Star Spangled Banner." How the men shouted
and clapped!</p>

<p>The actor sang it in public. It was caught up in camps, sung around
bivouac fires, and whistled in the streets. When peace was declared and
the people scattered to their homes, it was sung around thousands of
firesides.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Francis Scott Key</i><br /></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A man came from Europe to this country, and went to Cuba in 1867.
He was arrested as a spy, court-martialed and condemned to be shot. He
sent for the American and English consuls, and proved to them that he
was not a spy. They went to one of the Spanish officers and said, "This
man you have condemned to be shot is an innocent man." The Spanish
officer said, "The man has been legally tried by our laws and condemned,
and the law must take its course and the man must die." The next morning
the man was led out; the grave was already dug for him, the black
cap was put on him, the soldiers were there ready to receive the order
"Fire," and in a few moments the man would be shot and put in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
grave. Then the American consul took the American flag and wrapped it
around the prisoner, and the English consul took the English flag and
wrapped it around him, and they said to those soldiers, "Fire on those
flags if you dare!" Not a man dared. Why? <i>There were two great governments
behind those flags.</i></p>

<p>Let us love our flag, because behind it is "the greatest of the best and
the best of the great of all governments."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have told the story of the making of an American. There remains
to tell how I found out that he was made and finished at last. It was
when I went back to see my mother once more and, wandering about
the country of my childhood's memories, had come to the city of Elsinore
There I fell ill of a fever and lay many weeks in the house of
a friend upon the shore of the beautiful Oeresund. One day when the
fever had left me they rolled my bed into a room overlooking the sea.
The sunlight danced upon the waves, and the distant mountains of
Sweden were blue against the horizon. Ships passed under full sail up
and down the great waterway of the nations. But the sunshine and the
peaceful day bore no message to me. I lay moodily picking at the coverlet,
sick and discouraged and sore&mdash;I hardly knew why myself. Until all
at once there sailed past, close in shore, a ship flying at the top the flag
of freedom, blown out on the breeze till every star in it shone bright and
clear. That moment I knew. Gone were illness, discouragement and
gloom! Forgotten weakness and suffering, the cautions of doctor and
nurse. I sat up in bed and shouted, laughed and cried by turns, waving
my handkerchief to the flag out there. They thought I had lost my head,
but I told them no, thank God! I had found it, and my heart, too, at
last. I knew then it was my flag; that my children's home was mine,
indeed; that I also had become an American in truth. And I thanked
God, and, like unto the man sick of the palsy, arose from my bed and
went home, healed.</p>

<p class="caption3">RULES FOR FLAG ETIQUETTE</p>

<p>In no case should the flag be permitted to touch the ground, nor should
it be marred by advertisements, nor desecrated on the stage.</p>

<p>For indoor decorations the flag should only be used as a drapery; it
should not be used to cover a bench or table, or where anything can be
placed upon the flag.</p>

<p>No words, figures, pictures or marks of any kind should be placed upon
the flag.</p>

<p>When our national flag and state or other flags fly together, or are used
in decoration, our national flag should be on the right.</p>

<p>Whenever possible the flag should always be allowed to fly in the
breeze from a staff or mast, but if it should be necessary to fasten it to
the side of a building or platform, it should hang with the blue field at the
upper left hand corner. If hung where it can be seen from both sides, the
blue field should be toward the east or north.</p>

<p>The correct salute to the flag as required by the regulations of the
United States army is:</p>

<p>Standing at attention, raise the right hand to the forehead over the
right eye, palm downward, fingers extended and close together, arm at an
angle of forty-five degrees. Move hand outward about a foot, with a
quick motion, then drop it to the side.</p>

<p>The oath of allegiance to the flag, adopted by the N. S. D. A. R., and by
our military schools, the Boy Scouts and other organizations, and which
should be taught in all our public schools is:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"I pledge allegiance to my flag, and to the Republic for which it stands:
one Nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."</p>

<p>When the colors are passing on parade or in review, the spectator
should, if a man or boy, stand at attention and uncover.</p>

<p>When the "Star Spangled Banner" is played, all present should rise and
stand at attention until the ending.</p>

<p>When the flag is displayed at half mast, for mourning, it is lowered to
that position from the top of the staff. It is afterward hoisted to the top
before it is finally lowered.</p>

<p>When the flag is flown at half staff as a sign of mourning it should be
hoisted to full staff at the conclusion of the funeral.</p>

<p>When used on a bier or casket at a funeral, the stars should be placed
at the head.</p>

<p>Our most important holidays (when the flag should be displayed at full
staff) are: Lincoln's Birthday, February 12; Washington's Birthday,
February 22; Arbor Day; Memorial Day, May 30; Flag Day, June 14;
Independence Day, July 4; Columbus Day, October 12; Thanksgiving
Day, and State Day.</p>

<p>The flag should not be hoisted before sunrise or allowed to remain up
after sunset.</p>

<p>At "retreat," sunset, civilian spectators should stand at "attention" and
the men should remove their hats during the playing of the "Star
Spangled Banner." Military spectators are required by regulation to
stand at "attention" and give the military salute.</p>

<p>When the national colors are passing on parade, or in review, spectators
should, if walking, halt, and if sitting, rise and stand at attention, the
men removing their hats.</p>
